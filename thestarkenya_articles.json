    "summary": "Previous talks over a ceasefire and hostage release scheme in Qatar came to a halt this week after the US and Israel withdrew their negotiating teams.\nIsrael is facing mounting pressure from many of its allies, with aid agencies warning of mass starvation having previously criticised plans to drop supplies into Gaza by air.",
    "content": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to raise the situation in Gaza when he meets US President Donald Trump in Scotland on Monday.\nSir Keir is likely to welcome US efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, and discuss what more can be done to urgently get it in place.\nPrevious talks over a ceasefire and hostage release scheme in Qatar came to a halt this week after the US and Israel withdrew their negotiating teams.\nIsrael is facing mounting pressure from many of its allies, with aid agencies warning of mass starvation having previously criticised plans to drop supplies into Gaza by air.\nIsrael said on Sunday morning that it had dropped seven packages containing sugar, flour and canned food into Gaza, with the UAE, Jordan and Egypt in the process of delivering aid by land and air - but agencies say this is a fraction of what is needed to address malnutrition.\nSir Keir will convene the cabinet in the coming week, while Parliament is in recess, to discuss the ongoing situation in Gaza.\nIt comes after he confirmed his government was working with Jordan to drop aid into the territory and was \"urgently accelerating efforts\" to evacuate children who needed critical medical assistance to the UK.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast on Sunday, government minister James Murray said the situation in Gaza was \"utterly horrifying and appalling\".\n\"Starvation, access to food, must never be used as a means of war. It's completely unjustifiable and it must end,\" he said.\nForeign Secretary David Lammy said that while airdrops would help \"alleviate the worst of the suffering\", Israel must allow \"unhindered\" access for aid lorries as they are the \"only viable and sustainable\" way to get sufficient supplies to people.\nAt least 127 people in Gaza have died from malnutrition since the war began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael cut off all supplies to Gaza at the start of March in an 11-week blockade. It resumed distributing aid on 27 May with the new and controversial US-Israeli backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nThe GHF system has been widely criticised for forcing vast numbers of people to walk through active combat zones to a handful of sites.\nMore than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed trying to retrieve food aid from GHF sites since it began, according to the UN. Israel claims the new distribution system stops aid from reaching Hamas and denies restrictions are in place.\nMeanwhile, Trump touched down in Scotland on Friday and has been playing golf at his course in Turnberry, South Ayrshire, where he is also expected to meet EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday.\nScotland's First Minister John Swinney is also scheduled to hold a meeting with the US president during his short trip.\nLast week, Trump said Hamas \"didn't really want to make a deal\" on a new Gaza ceasefire deal.\nIn his statement announcing the withdrawal of the US team from Doha, US envoy Steve Witkoff said: \"Hamas does not appear to be co-ordinated or acting in good faith.\n\"We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza.\"\nSir Keir has come under pressure from home and abroad to recognise a Palestinian state, after French President Emmanuel Macron committed to doing so within months and more than a third of MPs signed a letter calling on the British government to do the same.\nThe SNP has also said it plans to introduce a bill in September to force a vote on statehood.\nOn Sunday, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the Tories had \"always supported\" a two-state solution - a political settlement based on two separate states that protect the rights of Palestinians and the security of Israelis.\nBut she said now was not the right time to recognise a Palestinian state as it would \"reward\" Hamas after \"carrying out one of the worst atrocities in recent memory\".\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 59,676 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "content": "A suspected drug trafficking attempt at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) was thwarted after a man allegedly fled during baggage inspection.\nThe Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said the individual left behind two suitcases that were later found to contain cannabis.\nAccording to police, the 57-year-old suspect had arrived in Nairobi from Bangkok, Thailand, and cleared immigration without issue.\nHowever, at the customs screening area, the suspect reportedly stepped away during inspection and exited the terminal.\nThe abandoned luggage prompted a search by Anti-Narcotics Unit officers, who discovered 41 sachets of cannabis sativa weighing 41.7 kilograms concealed in the bags.\nA search was immediately launched, and forensic leads helped detectives trace the suspect to a hotel in Nairobi’s South C estate, where he was apprehended.\n“He was arrested and escorted to JKIA Police Station, where he is currently in custody,” DCI said in a statement on Sunday.\nAuthorities said the suspect is undergoing standard processing and is expected to be charged in court.\nIn a separate incident earlier in January, at least five individuals were arrested in connection with an alleged attempt to traffic cocaine to Madagascar through JKIA.\nPolice said the arrests led to the recovery of 57 pellets of cocaine, with an estimated street value of Sh3.5 million.\nOne of the suspects was intercepted at Terminal A1’s central screening area while checking in for a flight to Madagascar.\nA body scanner reportedly revealed concealed items, leading to a search that uncovered over 600 grams of the substance.\nPolice said a field test confirmed the substance as cocaine.\nThe suspect was questioned by female anti-narcotics officers and is reported to have named another individual based in Nairobi as the recruiter.\nPolice said the second individual was located along Accra Road in Nairobi and taken into custody.\nFurther investigations led officers to a beauty shop, where 33 additional pellets were recovered. Three more people were also arrested during the operation.\nPolice say these cases are part of an ongoing crackdown on drug trafficking networks operating through Nairobi.",

    "content": "Auditor General Nancy Gathungu has exposed the ineffectiveness of the new university funding, highlighting various flaws in the model.\nThe Higher Education Loans Board’s model emphasises allocating resources based on financial need, addressing challenges such as affordability, inclusivity, and institutional sustainability.\nHowever, an audit report for the year endedJune 2024found that many of its aspects are not working.\nThe model shifts towards a student-centred funding approach and aims to make education more equitable, accessible and sustainable.\nMeans Testing Instrument (MTI) used for assessing the financial capacity of the students categorises them into five financial bands, 1 to 5. The instrument ensures targeted support through scholarships, loans and household contributions.\n“However, a review of documents and interviews with the Fund Management revealed critical challenges the model is facing,” the report said.\nAmong the challenges are inaccurate data submission by applicants, leading to distorted MTI scores; limited public awareness, leading to information gaps to the intended beneficiaries; and delays in funds disbursement in the form of loans and scholarships, disrupting students’ ability to pay tuition fees, access accommodation and cover living expenses.\nAdditionally, the Auditor General flagged inclusivity concerns, whereby vulnerable groups, such as students with disabilities or those from marginalised regions, face difficulties accessing the funds they need.\nThere are also emerging concerns on unique challenges, such as those faced by Muslim students, who require sharia-compliant financial products, further hindering inclusivity.\n“Loan repayment burden due to high unemployment and underemployment rates make it challenging for graduates to repay their loans, increasing default rates and threatening the sustainability of the revolving fund,” it said.\nAnother challenge highlighted is lack of coordination between the other government agencies dealing with the higher education students support, namely the Board and the State Department for Technical and Vocational Education and Training.\nThe model was also found to lack integration with the Kenya Universities Central Placement Service system to ensure seamless tracking of students from placements in the universities to funding.\n“In the circumstances, the effectiveness of the new funding model for higher education in supporting students funding requirements could not be confirmed,” Gathungu said.\nOnDecember 20last year, the High Court declared the fund unconstitutional for being discriminatory, finding that it violated students’ right to education.\nThe ruling also clarified the government's responsibility in funding public universities and passing the responsibility to parents was a violation of the Constitution as the legitimate expectation of the citizens was violated.\nThe ruling was, however, overturned by the Court of Appeal in March, clearing the way for its implementation.\nIn September last year,President William Ruto announced the establishment of the National Working Committee on the Review of the New University Education Funding Modelto address the challenges.\nThe committee comprised sub-committees: one to handle the review and refinement of the funding model for universities and technical, vocational education and training institutions (TVETs), and another to deal with appeals arising from the categorisation of students into various eligibility bands.\nThe committee proposed changes to the contested funding model, including uniform allocation of funds, reduction on cost of academic programmes by 23 per cent and for parents to be represented in university councils.",

    "content": "The foundational years of learning in Kenya are in crisis, a new education sector assessment report has warned.\nItreveals glaring gaps in Early Childhood Development and Education (ECDE) system that threaten to derail long-term learning outcomes under the Competency-Based Education (CBE).\nThe findings are contained in a report titled ‘State of Education in Kenya Research Report: Rapid Assessment of Gaps in the Education Sector 2025’.\nThe survey, conducted by Zizi Afrique Foundation and Usawa Agenda, show that despite increasing enrolment and investment, ECDE remains one of the most under-resourced levels of education in Kenya — marked by poor access, underqualified teachers, and significant regional disparities.\n“There’s growing investment in ECDE, but the gaps are still wide. Without attention to this foundational stage, the entire education reform agenda could crumble,” the report warns.\nNationally, 7.4 per cent of children enroll in Grade 1 without any prior ECDE experience, compromising their school readiness.\nThe situation is worse in rural areas, where exclusion from ECDE is higher (8.4 per cent) compared to urban areas (6.2 per cent).\nRegional inequalities are also stark, Mandera county leads with an exclusion rate of 51.4 per cent, followed by Marsabit at 33.3 per cent, while Kisumu (1.3 per cent) and Nakuru (1.8 per cent) have near-universal access.\nThe report notes that lack of ECDE participation impacts learning performance down the line.\nIt says children who attended preschool are 9 per cent more likely to perform better in mathematics and 18 per cent more likely to perform better in English than those who did not.\n“Preschool attendance significantly improves academic performance in later years,” the authors note, underscoring ECDE’s pivotal role in shaping learning outcomes under CBE, which prioritises progressive skill development.\nChildren with disabilities are particularly disadvantaged.\nThe report shows that 7.2 per cent of children with disabilities in Grade 1 and above have never attended ECDE, a figure nearly identical to their peers without disabilities, indicating a blanket lack of inclusive support.\nIn addition to access, teacher quality in ECDE is a major concern.\nThe report highlights that ECDE teachers often have “the lowest qualifications and shortest training” in the entire education system.\nThis undermines the effectiveness of early learning and risks entrenching inequality before formal primary education begins.\nMoreover, the national education data system lacks reliable school readiness indicators.\nThe Kenya School Readiness Assessment Tool (KISRAT), meant to provide this data, is still under review, while a platform to integrate ECDE data into the Kenya Education Management Information System (KEMIS) remains under development.\nWhile ECDE is constitutionally a devolved function, the report notes a lack of coordinated policy implementation between counties and the national government.\nThis leads to inconsistent standards and resource allocation across regions.\n“Given the devolved nature of ECDE, it is recommended to establish it as a distinct pillar, separate from Primary/Secondary education,” the report proposes.\nIt adds that this would enable better oversight and targeted investment.\nDespite the shortfalls, the report notes some positive strides made thus far.\nIt cites a nearly five per cent increase in ECDE enrolment between 2018 and 2021, attributing it to policy and infrastructure investments.\nThe report notes that major funders such as the LEGO Foundation, Conrad Hilton Foundation, Echidna Giving, and the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) have shown growing interest in ECDE.\nStill, the researchers caution that more needs to be done to “leverage funders, improve teacher quality, and eliminate regional disparities” if the country is to raise a generation of competent learners.\nThe authors conclude the report that “ECDE must be seen not as a peripheral issue, but as a central plank of education reform”.\nThey warn that neglecting it will jeopardise Kenya’s goal of preparing young citizens for lifelong learning and innovation.",

    "content": "Emotions ran high in Njogui-ini, Kirinyaga county, during the burial of 21-year-old Peter Macharia shot by police during Saba Saba protests.\nLeaders who attended the funeral directed a barrage of attacks on the government, accusing it of killing children, amid calls for justice and an end to police brutality and repression.\nKirinyaga Senator James Murango onMondayregretted that they were burying youths barely in their 20s every now and then.\n“Todaywe are burying Macharia, who was killed at a young age of 21.Tomorrowwe are burying Jackline [Nyawira], who was only 20 years old. Last week, we buried James Muriithi and Edwin Murimi, who were shot dead in Makutano and Kutus respectively,” he told mourners.\n“We continue to bury children without any justification for their killing. But we have decided that this country cannot continue like this. We’d rather be killed while standing but not kneeling.”\nThe previous week, Bridget Njoki, the 12-year-old girl shot by police during the Saba Saba demos, was buried in Ndumberi in a burial that offered a platform for residents and leaders to castigate the government over the killings.\nFamilies of those killed during the demos have decried being frustrated in their push for justice, accusing police of a cover-up.\nPresident William Ruto has also been accused of turning a blind eye to the plight of the families of the victims.\nThe Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has reported that up to 40 people were killed during the demos.\nThese killings have drawn condemnation from the civil society, social media users and even UDA members.\nKakamega Senator and Majority Whip Boni Khalwale, for instance, slammed the government for the killings during the burial of Elvis Musavi, who was also killed in the demos.\n“Elvis was a young man, he was a hustler. Given it is the hustlers who put us in power, and now we are shooting them, will we really get people to vote for us in 2027?” he asked.\nHe dismissed claims by Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen that Gen Zs want to overthrow the government, instead saying they are only seeking employment, livelihood and a means to thrive.\nA report by GeoPoll released last month, titled ‘Perceptions on theJune 2025Gen Z Protests in Kenya’, pointed to the youth’s wide dissatisfaction with the government.\n“Seventy-one per cent of respondents indicated that their voice is not being heard by the government,” the study said.\n“Only 11 per cent felt that their concerns are being acknowledged, while 18 per cent were unsure. In addition, most respondents, 79 per cent, believe that the government is not addressing the needs of the youth.”\nThe charging of the protesters with heavy terror charges has further worsened the relations between the government and the people.\nThe move was widely condemned, forcing the prosecution to drop terrorism charges against activist Boniface Mwangi. Dozens of demonstrators have been slapped with terror charges, which legal experts have condemned.\nFormer LSK president Eric Theuri has termed the charges “ridiculous” and lacking any legal foundation.\nInstead of the President extending an olive branch, he has blamed the protests on poor parenting and sponsorship by the opposition.\nImpeached Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua who is on a tour to the US accused the President of failing to listen to the youth.\nSpeaking during a meeting with clerics and community leaders in diaspora, Gachagua said Ruto should stop blaming the opposition and take responsibility.\n“Instead of listening to the GenZ, the issues they are raising — abductions, extra-judicial killings, corruption and misappropriation of public resources — the President says these people have been incited by Riggy G and Uhuru,” Gachagua said.",

But it is not enough to give every child in Kenya Sh22,000.”\nMbadi explained that the government policy stipulates that each student in a day secondary school should be allocated Sh22,000 annually, junior secondary school students Sh15,000, and those in primary schools Sh1,400.\nHowever, he revealed that the Treasury has never been able to meet the target of Sh22,000 per learner in full.",

The attack happened at the Algeis Malhadhon Adam area near Bodhai police camp.\nThree vehicles were damaged after being hit by explosives.\nOnJanuary 11the same year, four road engineers were killed when their vehicle was blown up by an explosive fired by the militants.\nThe workers were inspecting the road project when they came under attack in Bura East subcounty.\nOnDecember 21, three people, including two police officers, were killed between the Hayley Lapsset Camp and Garissa in similar attacks.\nOnDecember 30, the terrorists set an explosive device on the road in Mlima Faru, Lamu, which killed one soldier and injured five others when their vehicle ran over it.\nThe persistent attacks have forced Chinese contractors to abandon the site.\nThis also comes at a time when the government is planning to dissolve the Lapsset Authority as part of a larger plan to restructure government agencies.\nThe Cabinet approved the dissolution of nine corporations whose functions can be absorbed by their respective parent ministries.\nThe Lapsset Authority’s responsibilities will be integrated into the relevant government ministries.",

They are found in strategies and a plan,” the President said, reiterating his administration’s focus on economic transformation and service delivery.\nAddressing the opposition and political critics, Ruto challenged them to present alternative, viable development plans rather than vague calls for his removal.\n“If it is 'Ruto must go', then tell me how you want me to go.

He said the good infrastructure will help to support agriculture and other economic activities.“Our farmers can easily access markets and transport their produce and farm inputs because of the improved roads,” Bii said.The World Bank is also helping to tarmac roads in some of the informal settlements in Eldoret City to further boost the roads sector in the region.\nUasin Gishu county has acquired part of the machinery required to set up an asphalt plant expected to cost Sh700 million.",

    "content": "Residents of West Pokot carrying away iron sheets distributed by Governor Simon Kachapin under a plan to upgrade rural homes/ MATHEWS NDANYI\nOver 5,000 rural homes in West Pokot, where residents still live in grass-thatched houses, have been targeted for improvement, Governor Simon Kachapin has announced.\nThe transformative housing and energy project, dubbed the “Ondoa Nyasi initiative”, is a flagship programme aligned with the governor’s development manifesto, where he pledged to uplift the lives of vulnerable and low-income residents.\nIt also forms a key component of the West Pokot County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP). Kachapin said the project targets the replacement of traditional grass-thatched roofs – which remain common across many parts of the county – with modern iron sheet roofing.\n“While grass thatching once reflected our community’s cultural identity, it now poses serious risks, including fire hazards, vulnerability to floods and exposure to extreme weather,” he said.\nHe emphasised that this transition represents more than just a structural change, terming it “an investment in safety, dignity and opportunity for families across West Pokot”.\n“With mabati roofing, households will enjoy safer and healthier living conditions. These homes can support clean energy through solar lighting, harvest rainwater and offer better learning environments for our children,” he added.\nThe county government will work with development partners to distribute iron sheets and other construction materials to enable families to build better homes.\nSome of the families received the materials during the official launch of the initiative at the governor’s office.\nExpanding access to clean energy through Kosap\nTwo weeks earlier, Kachapin revealed that over 20,000 families would benefit from the Kenya Off-Grid Solar Access Project (Kosap), which aims to provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to underserved communities.\nThe county boss hosted officials from the Kenya Power Company and Kosap in a planning meeting for the official handover of the initiative to Hypertek Engineering, the project’s technical implementation partner.\nWest Pokot is among 14 counties benefiting from the Sh10 billion project launched earlier this year by President William Ruto.\n“The initiative is already making a significant impact by enhancing access to clean, reliable and affordable energy across the county,” Kachapin said.\nHe added that institutions in the Health and Education sectors are also included in the programme.\nSo far, 31 health facilities and several schools across North Pokot, Pokot South, Pokot Central and West Pokot sub-counties have been solarised.\nThe project ensures uninterrupted power supply to critical services, including healthcare and education.\nLighting up homes and lives\nUnder the “Lighting Up Homes and Lives” component, over 16,500 households in West Pokot have received home solar systems, improving safety, security and quality of life.\nIn addition, 5,000 families have transitioned to cleaner cooking technologies through the adoption of improved cookstoves, reducing health risks and environmental impact.\n“This life-changing component will especially benefit our women, who are primarily responsible for feeding our families. They will now cook using clean energy,” the governor noted.\nPowering community infrastructure\nThe project also includes the solarisation of 33 boreholes in Pokot Central, Kipkomo and North Pokot, boosting access to safe and sustainable water sources in remote communities.\nFurther, the initiative focuses on building local capacity to ensure long-term sustainability. County staff are undergoing training in solar energy systems, project management and environmental conservation.\nKachapin reiterated his administration’s commitment to fostering strategic partnerships that deliver impactful services to the people of West Pokot.\n“The successful implementation of Kosap shows the value of collaborative development and the power of clean energy to transform rural communities.\n“West Pokot is firmly on the path toward clean, affordable and sustainable energy for all. We appreciate the continued support from our national and development partners in making this vision a reality,” he said.",

    "content": "Nairobi's massive water losses annually are because of poorly maintained infrastructure inherited from previous administrations, Governor Johnson Sakajahas said.\nThe Senate’s County Public Investment Committeesummoned him earlier this week to explain the huge scale of unaccounted-for water in the capital as residents grapple with water rationing.\n“Governor, auditors say 51 per cent of water produced, worth Sh8.6 billion, simply vanished. How do we explain this to the rate-payers?” the committee chair Godfrey Osotsi asked Sakaja during the hearing.\nSakaja, who succeeded Mike Sonko and Evans Kidero, acknowledged the gravity of the situation but blamed years of neglect.\n“We inherited antiquated pipes and deferred capital works,” he said.\n\"We have now ring-fenced Sh9.2 billion in the 2024-25 budget for meter sealing, leak detection and pipeline rehabilitation.\"\nHe said his administration has earmarked Sh9.2 billion in the new financial year 2024-25 budget to address the problem.\nThe funds will be directed towards fixing leaking pipes, improving meter accuracy and rehabilitating dilapidated pipelines.\nHis response painted a picture of a system long overdue for overhaul, with years of underinvestment compounding the county’s woes.\nThe senators also scrutinised the county’s revenue management, especially the accumulation of unpaid bills, which currently stand at a staggering Sh11 billion and have remained outstanding for more than 480 days.\nNairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna was particularly scathing in his assessment.\n“Sh11 billion sits in receivables over 480 days. Demand letters alone won’t cut it. Where is the recovery plan?” Sifuna asked, pressing the governor for a concrete strategy to improve debt collection.\nSakaja outlined steps already taken to recover some of the debts, including the establishment of two new revenue zones and the launch of a GIS billing platform in February aimed at improving billing accuracy.\nHe added that debts exceeding Sh1 million had been referred to legal teams for recovery, and 1,938 previously unbilled accounts were now being invoiced.\nDespite these measures, the committee’s concerns extended beyond water loss and revenue recovery. The county’s salary expenditure was flagged as another major financial challenge.\nCurrently, salaries take up about 65 per cent of Nairobi’s revenue, far exceeding the recommended cap of 35 per cent, raising serious questions about financial sustainability.\nIn response, Sakaja said his administration had implemented strict cost-saving measures to rein in wage bills. These include a hiring freeze on non-essential positions and decentralising services to cut down on overtime payments, which had inflated salary costs.\nAdditionally, Sakaja said the county has submitted a cost-recovery tariff proposal to the Water Services Regulatory Board. The aim is to reduce the wage-to-revenue ratio to 45 per cent within the next year, a move that could significantly improve Nairobi’s financial health.\nWhile the governor’s responses provided some reassurance, the session revealed the scale of Nairobi’s water and financial challenges.\nINSTANT ANALYSIS\nWith billions lost annually through leaks and unpaid bills, and a bloated wage bill draining resources, Nairobi’s water crisis is as much a management issue as it is an infrastructure one. The coming months will be critical as the county seeks to turn its fortunes around.",

Southern regions\r\nhave benefited from good rains, improving food access. However, the North and East have experienced flooding and insecurity, which have displaced communities\r\nand disrupted farming. In Central Kenya, irregular rainfall has led to poor\r\nharvests and reduced incomes for smallholder farmers.\nThe Food Security Monitor report shows that across East\r\nAfrica, food prices have continued to rise due to ongoing conflicts, unstable\r\neconomies, seasonal shifts and weakening currencies.\n“Food prices remain high across the region, particularly in\r\nKenya, South Sudan, and Uganda, due to structural and economic pressures,” the\r\nreport states.\nSince October 2024, the number of people facing hunger has\r\nremained high across five East African countries. Compared to the same time\r\nlast year, the number has risen by 12.3 million people.\n“Uganda has seen the sharpest increase, from eight million in\r\nJune 2024 to 18 million in June 2025, a 125 per cent rise.

These declines are largely attributed to seasonal availability\r\nduring the green harvest season. However, prices for Kenya's red beans continue to climb, posting consistent increases over the past one to\r\n12 months.\nThe report also notes that wheat prices in Kenya dropped by\r\nfive per cent, settling at Sh100,620 per metric ton, mainly due to declining global prices driven by bumper harvests\r\nin the Black Sea region and increased exports from Russia.",

    "content": "A new UN-backed report\r\nhas sounded an alarm over dangers facing Kenya’s wildlife.\nThe Drought Hotspots Around the\r\nWorld 2023–25 report, released by the US National Drought\r\nMitigation Center and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, warns that\r\nprolonged droughts, caused by global warming and compounded by human\r\npressures, are destroying animal populations.\nThe report identifies eastern and southern Africa as some of the worst-hit regions, where fragile ecosystems have\r\nbegun to collapse under the weight of climatic and human stress.\nIn Kenya, the effects are being felt most\r\nacutely in arid regions such as Kajiado, Tsavo and Laikipia, where wildlife is\r\nincreasingly coming into conflict with communities battling their own survival.\nOne incident highlighted in\r\nthe report occurred in June 2023, when six lions were speared to death by\r\nherders in Kajiado county after they killed a dozen goats. The lions had\r\nstrayed from Amboseli National Park, driven by hunger and thirst into human\r\nsettlements.\n“The Maasai herder, who lost half his livestock, said the compensation offered would\r\nnot replace his economic loss.” Historically, the Maasai have lived in harmony\r\nwith lions, but drought has pushed  man and beast into new and dangerous\r\nterritory.\nEl Niño’s return in 2023 led to a\r\nglobal temperature surge, with Kenya experiencing extreme drought conditions\r\nthat have persisted into 2025. Water sources in Tsavo East and West National\r\nParks have dried up, forcing elephants and predators into nearby villages in\r\nsearch of food and water. These encounters often end in violence, as\r\ncommunities, already facing hardship, respond with lethal force.\nDr Henno Havenga of the Unit for\r\nEnvironmental Sciences and Management at North-West University in South Africa\r\noffers a broader ecological explanation.\n“Human-animal interactions are\r\nbecoming more complex due to climate change, but we must remember that we’ve\r\nfundamentally altered animals’ natural migrations,” he said. “Droughts have\r\nalways occurred, but in the meantime, we’ve put up fences at every turn. Where\r\nelephants once migrated thousands of kilometres in search of food and water,\r\nthey are now trapped in fixed reserves.”\nHavenga warned that this restriction “turns\r\nsurvival into conflict,” explaining that when animals can no longer migrate,\r\nthey inevitably come into contact with humans. “It rarely ends well for the\r\nanimal,” he said.\nAlthough some animals die directly from drought, especially the old or sick,\r\nmany are killed due to their proximity to humans. “Most of the deaths\r\naren’t simple acts of nature,” he cautioned, “but the result of conservation\r\nsystems pushed to breaking point.”\nThe report also draws comparisons\r\nwith regional neighbours. In Zimbabwe, more than 100 elephants died in late 2023\r\nwhen drying watering holes became deadly mud traps. The situation led to the\r\ncontroversial culling of 200 elephants, a move justified by the government due\r\nto the population exceeding sustainable capacity. Namibia followed suit with\r\nplans to cull more than 600 animals, including zebra, buffalo, impala and\r\nhippos.\nIn Kenya, conservationists and\r\ncommunity leaders now face the daunting task of balancing wildlife\r\npreservation with human livelihood. The report’s authors warn that without\r\nurgent reform—including the restoration of migratory corridors and investment\r\nin drought resilience—people and wildlife will continue to suffer.\nAs climate shocks become more\r\nfrequent, the cost of inaction may prove catastrophic. The survival of Kenya’s\r\niconic species and the communities that have long coexisted with them now hang\r\nin a delicate balance.",

Their lives, once\r\nmodest but stable, were ripped apart by flames that devoured everything in\r\nsight.\nBy sunrise, many families, though lucky to have escaped with\r\nlife, now face even grinding poverty as they have lost everything.\nFrom makeshift hotels, Mama Mboga business stalls to stores\r\nof wares and shanty homes lapped by the unrelenting tongue of fire, the\r\nunforgiving urban poverty that residents had known how to keep up with will now\r\nonly get harsher for them.\nAccording to reports, the late night fire started with a\r\nstrange glow near a metal container at the edge of the village.\nThe tragedy comes just days after fire tore down the\r\nhandcraft section of Kamukunji market compounding the almost predictable fire\r\nincidents in the city marred by characteristic poor response.\nWitnesses claim that someone had set tires alight beneath\r\nit—why or who, no one knows.Fueled by\r\nwind and flammable building materials, it tore through the village like a beast\r\nunleashed.\nArea police say investigation is ongoing to determine\r\nwhether the fire was an act of arson or an accident.\nWhat remained was not just rubble and smoke, but a raw kind\r\nof silence—where grief hangs heavier than the heat still rising from the\r\nground.\nAmong those now stranded is Naomi Wanjiru, a 34-year-old\r\nmother of three, who was awakened by frantic knocking.\n“I thought I was dreaming,” she said. “But when I opened the\r\ndoor, the sky was orange.

According to Peter Njoroge, a local elder, firefighters reached the\r\nscene but couldn’t access the heart of the fire in time.\n“The main garage gate was locked. That was the quickest way\r\nin,” he said. “Instead, they had to squeeze in through a tiny side gate, and by\r\nthen, the fire had already spread too far.”\nThe consequences were devastating. Homes built closely\r\ntogether in the densely packed village created a firetrap. People had minutes\r\nothers seconds, to escape. Many didn’t even manage to grab their IDs or\r\nchildren’s school bags.\nMiriam Atieno, a single mother of four, was among the\r\nhardest hit. “We have nothing. Their school books, uniforms, everything is\r\ngone,” she said, as her youngest daughter clung to her lap. “They didn’t go to\r\nschool today. I don’t know when they will again.”\nAll around her, families sat on mattresses, clutching\r\ncarrier bags with the little they managed to save. Infants cried from hunger\r\nand confusion. Elderly residents stared blankly at the blackened outlines of\r\nhomes they had lived in for decades.\nAnd yet, the worst wound was not just physical loss—but the\r\nunanswered questions. Who set the fire? Was it targeted? Was it negligence or\r\nmalice? The community wants answers, and fast.\n“This wasn’t just an accident,” insisted James Kiptoo, a\r\n61-year-old resident. “You don’t just find tires burning under a container for\r\nno reason. We need an investigation. We need justice.”\nLocal leaders have called for government intervention,\r\nurging officials to provide temporary shelter, food aid and rebuild plans. But\r\nfor now, the people of Kasilili wait—huddled under tarps beside the roads,\r\nclinging to one another in the chill of an uncertain tomorrow.\n“We may be alive,” Naomi says, “but what kind of life is\r\nthis?”\nAs night falls again on Kasilili village, the flames are\r\ngone—but the pain is only beginning.\nInstant Analysis:\nBeyond the blaze lies a deeper story of neglect, desperation\r\nand unanswered questions. Kasilili’s tragedy is a stark reminder of Nairobi’s\r\ngrowing urban vulnerability—and the high human cost when infrastructure and\r\naccountability fall short.",

    "content": "A new youth-driven political party, the People’s Forum for\r\nRebuilding Democracy (PFRD), is set to officially launch and participate in the\r\nupcoming by-elections.\nFormed by a coalition of professionals and members of Gen Z,\r\nPFRD has distinguished itself through a focus on innovation, inclusivity, and\r\nstrategic organisation.\nThe party’s symbol — a ballpoint pen — reflects its emphasis\r\non intellectual engagement, education, and policy-driven leadership.\nWhile other political parties are often registered and\r\nlaunched in a matter of months, PFRD’s registration has taken three years — not\r\ndue to setbacks, but by design.\nAccording to party officials, the delay was due to its\r\nselection by the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) to pilot\r\nthe new Integrated Political Parties Management Information System (IPPMIS), a\r\nsystem intended to streamline and modernise party registration and operations\r\nacross the country.\n“The registration process has been long but deliberate,” a\r\nsenior party official said. “PFRD was among the few chosen to pilot integration\r\ninto IPPMIS, which will bring transparency and technological advancement into\r\nKenya’s political space.”\nA letter from the Registrar confirms that PFRD is now fully\r\nregistered, paving the way for its formal launch and participation in national\r\npolitics.\nSam Ogendo, the party’s lead advisor and a respected figure\r\nin civic tech and governance, claims PFRD is the first political party in Kenya\r\nto integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and modern technology into its daily\r\noperations — a move designed to ensure accountability, manage data-driven\r\ncampaigning, and enhance engagement with the public, particularly younger\r\nvoters.\n“PFRD is not only a political party but a movement of young,\r\nbrilliant minds from all corners of the republic who are tired of recycled\r\npolitics,” Ogendo stated.\n“We are introducing a new culture — where politics is\r\norganized, efficient, and future-focused.”\nOgendo said the use of AI and digital tools will allow the\r\nparty to better connect with Kenyans across all demographics and manage\r\nreal-time political intelligence, voter engagement, and grassroots\r\nmobilization.\nThe party has operational offices in over 26 counties and\r\nstructured leadership teams in targeted regions.\nThe party is expected to begin its membership registration\r\nprocess shortly after the launch, which will also incorporate digital platforms\r\nto make joining easier and more transparent.\nThe announcement has caught the attention of political\r\nanalysts, who view PFRD as a disruptive force, especially amid a wave of\r\ndissatisfaction among Kenya’s youth and professionals who feel alienated by\r\ntraditional political structures.\n“This could be a headache for older parties,” said political\r\ncommentator Caroline Njoroge. “PFRD has two powerful tools: a direct connection\r\nto Gen Z — arguably the most vocal and mobilized demographic in Kenya today —\r\nand a core team of educated professionals who understand both governance and\r\ntechnology.”\nThe launch date of the party is expected to be announced\r\nsoon, with anticipation already building online as Gen Z supporters flood\r\nsocial media with hashtags linked to the movement.",

We are not only\r\ncreating jobs but also building a healthier and more dignified city for all\r\nNairobians,” he added.\nNairobi County Executive Committee (CEC)\r\nMember for Green Nairobi, Maureen Njeri, confirmed that the confirmation\r\nprocess is already underway.\n“The names of the 2,000 workers have been\r\nsubmitted to the County Public Service Board,” Njeri said.\n“They will undergo verification and\r\npresent the necessary documentation before being officially enrolled as\r\npermanent county employees.”\nShe also revealed that the county has\r\nlong-term plans to restructure sanitation services through the formation of an\r\nindependent entity.\n“This is a major step forward. Once the\r\nprocesses are completed, these workers will eventually transition into the\r\nGreen Nairobi Company, an autonomous body that will manage city cleanliness in\r\na more structured and professional way,” she explained.\nNjeri noted that the Green Army has employed\r\nmore than 3,500 young people in Nairobi over the past two and a half years.\nThe programme, she said, has provided not just employment, but also helped\r\ntransform the city’s sanitation and public space management.\n“The Green Army has changed how we manage our\r\nenvironment—from garbage collection and river restoration to tree planting and\r\nstreet cleaning,” she said. “Their contribution has been immense.”\nThe Green Army’s responsibilities include\r\nsweeping streets, cleaning public spaces, restoring rivers, collecting garbage,\r\nplanting trees, and beautification initiatives across the county.\nThey also help maintain the city’s final waste disposal site and support\r\nmajor clean-up exercises within the Central Business District (CBD) and\r\nsurrounding estates.\nGovernor Sakaja said the initiative aligns\r\nwith his administration’s goal of improving both livelihoods and the urban\r\nenvironment.\n“Nairobi cannot be a world-class city without\r\nclean streets, green spaces, and empowered youth,” he said. “That’s the\r\ndirection we’re heading.”",

Those who have been able\r\nto access it have done so with the help of human rights organisations, and many\r\nhave given up along the way,” she says.\nWith the refugee ID they will be able to get the KRA pin\r\nnumber, Social Health Authority health cover, travel documents, and legal\r\nservices.\nShiundu said they want the government to come up with a\r\nstep-by-step process that refugees need to follow to help them get the documents\r\neasily.\n\"At the moment, some are accessing these services using\r\nthe refugee IDs.

    "content": "Residents of Baraki and Maalim in Garissa County's Lagdera sub-county are finally enjoying access to clean water after the commissioning of a major water project in the area.\nFor over a century, communities in the region have struggled without a reliable source, depending instead on shallow wells and water trucking services from the county government.\nThe newly launched project, led by the Garissa County Government and supported by the Financing Locally Led Climate Action (FLOCA) programme, is a transformative development that promises to change lives. It includes a 48-kilometre pipeline from Baraki and a 50-cubic-meter water pan.\nSpeaking at the commissioning ceremony, Governor Nathif Jama described the initiative as a “lifeline” and a symbol of resilience, determination, and collaboration.\n“Today I am an extremely happy man as I stand before you to commission this water project. Water is life, it is everything that sustains life itself. To witness clean and quality water freely flowing is a dream come true,” he said.\nThe project, which began in October 2016 and was completed in June 2025, includes three boreholes—two of which are operational, producing 40,000 litres per hour.\nIt also features two booster stations, each equipped with a 225,000-litre masonry tank at Guyobombi and Languyatta, along with multiple public water points.\nMore than 2,000 households are set to benefit directly from the project, including 75 in Maalim and 45 in Afweine.

That ends today,” he said, thanking residents for their patience and support.\nJama also announced plans to solarize the boreholes to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions, with backing from CARE Kenya and Islamic Relief.\nHe said this will open the door to carbon credit opportunities and future climate finance.\n“The successful implementation of this project shows what is possible when governments, communities, and partners come together. Let us now take full ownership of the system—protect it, govern it well, and make sure it serves generations to come,” he added.\nWajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi, who attended the event, said the infrastructure would improve public health, support livelihoods, and increase resilience to climate shocks.\n“This initiative strengthens public health, supports local livelihoods, and fosters community-driven development,” he said.\nFor local residents, the moment was deeply emotional.\nMohamed Hussein, a 70-year-old resident of Baraki, called it “a new dawn.”\n“To say that we have suffered for decades for lack of water is an understatement,” he said. “Today, I cannot hide my joy seeing water flow from taps.”\nHalima Noor also shared her relief, recalling how generations of women and girls fetched water from distant and unreliable sources.\n“Our mothers and daughters, some as young as three, would wake up early to fetch water. Many times, they’d come back empty-handed. It’s a painful story. But now that is history. It is a new dawn for us,” she said.\nThe launch was attended by senior national and county leaders, including Principal Secretary for ASAL and Regional Development Harsama Kello, Garissa Senator Abdul Haji, PS Maritime Affairs Eng.

Moreover, the Bamba Chakula cash/voucher assistance has been\r\nsuspended.\nSpeaking to the press in Garissa town while unveiling land\r\nfor the Fafi Madrasa Waqf, Yakub decried the decision as shortsighted and\r\ndamaging.\n“Today ... refugees don’t have food and water. Healthcare is\r\nin a total mess; their education is in big trouble ... We are likely to see an\r\nincrease in malnutrition and insecurity both in the camps and outside the camps\r\nwhere host communities live.”\nHe warned that cuts have already triggered a rise in\r\npoaching and charcoal burning by desperate refugees—a direct consequence of\r\nstarvation and loss of support systems.\n“We demand the total revocation of the current programe.

According to the institute’s director, Architect Geoffrey Githiri, the expansion is part of a broader national push for inclusive development through localised technical education.“A campus in Marsabit will do more than offer training—it will spur economic growth, diversify livelihoods, and boost social mobility in Northern Kenya,” said Githiri.He added that such an institution could also serve as a hub for climate-resilient construction and engineering solutions tailored to the region’s arid conditions.The presence of the college, he said, could lead to better healthcare, stronger communities, and even greater cultural vibrancy.“As globalisation accelerates, the world becomes increasingly connected, allowing individuals to explore diverse experiences,” Githiri noted. “We must ensure that Marsabit is not left behind.”As the proposal gains momentum, the people of Marsabit are hoping it marks the start of a new chapter—one built with their own hands.\nA proposal to open a campus of the Kenya Institute of Highways and Building Technology (KIHBT) in Marsabit County has stirred excitement across the region.\nLeaders and residents hail it as a potential turning point for youth empowerment and development.\nLocated in Kenya’s far north and sharing a border with Ethiopia, Marsabit has long struggled with poor infrastructure and a shortage of skilled professionals.\nNow, the idea of a local KIHBT branch is being seen as a practical solution to both.\n“For years, many youths here have finished secondary school but had no access to technical training,” said Hillary Halkano, North Horr Sub-county Road Overseer.\n“A KIHBT campus would equip them with the skills to build our own roads, houses, and water systems.”\nHalkano, who graduated from the KIHBT Ngong campus in 2022, praised the institution’s hands-on approach to training.\nHe noted that construction projects in Marsabit currently rely heavily on workers brought in from other parts of the country, driving up costs and delaying progress.\nA local campus, he believes, would reduce this dependency and allow projects to move faster and more affordably.\nYoung people in the region would gain access to courses in civil engineering, road construction, building technology, and water services, without the burden of relocating far from home.\nKatelo Duba, Chairperson of the Turbi Peace and Development Committee, echoed these sentiments, noting that the county’s long-standing development challenges—such as poor roads and limited water access—are deeply tied to the lack of local technical expertise.\n“With our own skilled labour force, we won’t have to wait for contractors from Nairobi or other towns,” said Duba. “It will cut costs, save time, and boost the local economy.”\nNorth Horr Member of Parliament Wario Guyo also backed the proposal, saying it fits into Marsabit’s development goals and supports national efforts to expand Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET).\nHe emphasised that the institute would not only offer skills training but would also generate jobs and attract supporting services like student housing, ICT hubs, and small businesses.\n“This is more than education; it’s empowerment,” said Guyo. “We want our youth to be the ones designing and maintaining our roads—not watching from the sidelines.”\nThe proposed campus would be KIHBT’s fifth nationwide.

This improves patient flow, accountability and data for planning,\" Salah said.\n“The digitisation has also reduced manual work and administrative tasks such as billing, appointment scheduling and inventory. Workflow has also been streamlined and doctors,nurses and administrative staff can now easily collaborate with a lot of ease.\"\nThe digital system has also reduced the need for physical storage and paper-based documentation hence optimised resource use.\nSalah said the automation has also increased revenue.\n“Healthcare is not a luxury. It is a human right. Our vision is to make Garissa County Teaching and Referral Hospital a centre of excellence in quality, affordable and accessible health services for all residents of northern Kenya,\" he said.\nSalah said his next urgent priority is infrastructure upgrade and expansion. Over the past year, the hospital has renovated its maternity and emergency units and is currently building a new neonatal ICU ward.\nIt serves as a referral centre for six counties; Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Tana River, Isiolo and parts of Marsabit.\nThe referral hospital receives hundreds of patients daily, many of them low-income earners, pastoralists and refugees from Dadaab, placing an enormous pressure on its infrastructure and staff.\nA modern oxygen plant has been installed rehabilitation work completed on its main operating theatre — a move that has reduced reliance on costly referrals to Nairobi and Mombasa.\nThe hospitalis also working to integrate the Social Health Authority scheme to reduce out-of-pocket payments and ease access to services.\nDespite the progress, Salah is candid about persisting challenges such as irregular medical supplies, limited funding, understaffing and long waiting times.\n“Our staff are stretched. We need more doctors, nurses and lab technicians. We’re engaging the county government and the Ministry of Health for support,” he said.\nThe CEO also called for community involvement in safeguarding hospital facilities and curbing misuse of services.\nHe urged development partners, donors and NGOs to collaborate in strengthening the region’s health system.\n“Health is not just a government issue — it is everyone’s responsibility,” Mahat said. “We invite partnerships in cancer screening, dialysis, maternal health and nutrition.”\nThe construction of a new mother-and-child wing which is nearing completion is expected to expand capacity to more than 400 beds to serve the broader northern Kenya region and additional cross-border demand—including neighboring counties and Somalia.\nThe entrance of the Garissa county teaching and referral\r\nhospital.",

    "content": "Blue Economy CS Ali Hassan Joho during the commissioning of Kenya’s first National Marine Hatchery at the National Mariculture Resource and Training Centre (NAMARET) in Shimoni, Kwale County/HANDOUT\nThere’s fresh hope for coastal fisherfolk following the commissioning of the first National Marine Hatchery in Shimoni, Kwale county.\nThe facility was launched on Wednesday by Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs CS, Hassan Joho.\nIt is a product of collaboration between the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) and the national government.\nThe hatchery is designed for large-scale production of fingerlings, specifically prawns and rabbitfish (locally known as 'taffi'), which are in high demand both locally and abroad.\nKMFRI’s assistant director for Mariculture, Dr Antony Nzioka, said the hatchery has the capacity to produce over one million seedlings per cycle, with four cycles annually, translating to at least four million quality fingerlings every year.\n“This hatchery will go a long way in addressing the challenge of seed shortage that has for long crippled the expansion of mariculture activities along the Kenyan coast,” Nzioka said.\nFarmers will now be able to access affordable, quality seedlings, which will in turn boost fish and prawn production, improve livelihoods and strengthen the country’s blue economy.\n“Now, farmers can access healthy fingerlings affordably and in the beginning, they’ll even be distributed free of charge as part of a pilot,” he said.\nAfter the government-supported pilot period, a minimal cost-sharing model will be introduced to ensure the sustainability of the project.\nThe hatchery will also serve as a research and training centre for upcoming aquaculture farmers, students and marine researchers.\nFor decades, fisherfolk have relied on dwindling wild stocks for their livelihoods.\nAccess to quality fingerlings will improve their yields and reduce dependence on unpredictable ocean harvests.\nWith seedlings now readily available, farmers can venture into commercial mariculture by setting up ponds for prawn and fish farming.\nHe noted that the fingerlings have a short maturity period, allowing farmers to harvest every four months, creating a consistent source of income.\n“This is a major step towards empowering our coastal communities. Now that the major hurdle of accessing quality seed is removed, farmers can engage in aquaculture all year round and significantly boost household income,” he said.\nTo further support the initiative, KMFRI has conducted extensive research on the use of locally available materials to develop cost-effective fish feed.\nNzioka pointed out that one of the biggest challenges in aquaculture is the high cost of commercial feeds, which often eats into farmers' profits.\nA small-scale fish farmer from Shimoni, Omar Shaame, said the project has renewed hope for many coastal families. He said they have been depending on the ocean, but the catches are no longer reliable.\n“With the hatchery, farmers can now raise fish in a pond at home and plan their income,” he said.\nPrawn farmer Mwinyi Hassan said the facility will ease the burden of travelling long distances in search of quality fingerlings.\n“Before, we had to go all the way to Mombasa or even wait for middlemen–and that was very expensive. Now we have our own hatchery in Shimoni. This is a huge relief,” he said.\nInstant Analysis\nThe National Marine Hatchery in Shimoni marks a turning point for Kenya’s coastal fisheries. For decades, fisherfolk have struggled with dwindling ocean stocks and lack of access to quality fingerlings, limiting their productivity and income.\nThis state-of-the-art facility directly addresses those challenges by offering a reliable, local source of prawn and rabbitfish seedlings.",

The findings will inform conservation strategies and policy\r\ndecisions.\nThe final National Wildlife Census report is anticipated to\r\nbe submitted to the President by August 2025.",

At one point we even visited farmers in Naivasha to see how best we can support them,” he said.These visits to the farmers will continue, Ruto said, as will the support for transit countries to lure them to use the Mombasa and Lamu ports.

    "content": "Residents of Makuyu in Maragua subcounty, Murang’a\r\ncounty, on Friday took to the streets to protest against failure by a fruits processing\r\ncompany to resettle squatters living on its land.\nThe residents walked to Kakuzi offices on the Kenol-Sagana highway, demanding to be addressed by the company’s management.\nBut after hours of waiting and chanting at the company’s\r\nentrance, the residents aired their grievances through a loud speaker before\r\ntrekking over seven kilometres to Gachagi village, where 25 families have\r\nbeen squatting for decades.\nThe families were originally 35 and belonged to elderly\r\nworkers of the company whom the board of management allegedly agreed to\r\nresettle as a way of compensating them for working on its farm for years.\nAndrew Thuo, who served as the community liason officer under\r\nthe company, claimed that initially, about 400 acres were set aside by\r\nformer directors to resettle the workers and their families.\nMany other families were resettled in areas such as in\r\nGathungururu, Thangira, Mwambu, Ngaatho, Ithanga and other villages, with some\r\ngetting as much as four acres each, as Gachagi squatters waited for their turn.\nThe squatters started agitating for the resettlement in 2004\r\nand formed a committee that started engaging the company on the matter.\nIn 2018, about 10 families were resettled on one acre plots,\r\nleaving 25 others in the camp.\nBut Thuo said he stopped working with the company last\r\nmonth after realising that efforts to follow up on deliberations were not\r\nbearing fruit.\n“I have been trying to get the company to resettle the\r\nsquatters and every time we agree about it, no action is taken. This has pitted\r\nme against my own community,” he said.\nSammy Ndata, a resident, said they have grown tired of\r\nwaiting for the company to keep its word and resettle them.\nHe said the conditions at the Gachagi camp are\r\ndire, with many families lacking the basic sanitary amenities.\n“Even the houses are made of mud and are in poor condition.\r\nThe toilets are few and have plastic walls with no roof,” Ndatasaid.\nThe squatters had expressed concerns that drones used by the\r\ncompany to surveil its vast land invades their privacy as their bathrooms and\r\ntoilets don’t have proper walls and roofs.\nHe further claimed some women have suffered sexual\r\nviolence at the hands of the company’s security guards, who find them collecting\r\nfirewood.\nMP Mary Waithera, who accompanied the squatters, vowed to ensure protests are held every week until the company budges.\nShe said she has been part of efforts to\r\nresettle the squatters and has attended about six meetings at the company's offices.\nThe meetings, the MP added, were also attended by\r\nadministrators and a Memorandum of Understanding drawn.\nWaithera said stakeholders were at some point taken by the\r\ncompany’s managers to the 35 acres set aside for resettlement of the squatters\r\nand beacons had been erected on the land.\nThe MP expressed her shock and frustration with the company’s\r\nfailure to follow up on what was agreed upon in the MoU, saying the delay is\r\nsubjecting the squatters to unimaginable humanitarian suffering.\nShe urged human rights organisations to join the fight\r\nand help the families get their right while improving their living conditions.\nThe families are forced to bury their loved ones in public\r\ncemeteries and are unable to engage in farming activities, forcing them to\r\ndepend on casual jobs.\nThe company had in 2020 gone through turbulent times after\r\nsome of its international buyers stopped buying their products due to human\r\nrights issues.\n“Even now, we are calling upon their buyers to stop buying their\r\nproducts until they stop subjecting these families to suffering. If the land\r\nhas been set aside to resettle them, why the delay?” she wondered.\nOn May 29 this year, the company’s executive head of\r\ncorporate affairs Simon Odhiambo denied the firm ever promised to ‘gift’\r\nany of its land holdings to Gachagi residents as alleged.\n“Over the years, a mutually agreed upon MoU has been in\r\nplace between the residents and Kakuzi. It permits specific community members, who are parties to the MoU, to occupy a portion of our land, measuring 10 acres\r\nin consideration of an annual fee and adherence to set conditions,” he said.\n“Recently, a section of Gachagi residents have challenged this\r\nMoU and the matter is before the National Land Commission and the courts,\r\nwhere we await determination”.\nOdhiambo also defended the use of drones, saying they are\r\nused to ensure there’s security on its vast orchard.\nBut Deputy President Kindiki Kithure, who attended an\r\nempowerment forum at Kimorori grounds in Kenol on Friday, donated Sh2 million to help the\r\nfamilies construct better houses.\nKindiki was responding to MP Waithera’s request for help.\nInstant Analysis\nThe squatters started agitating for resettlement in 2004\r\nand formed committee that started engaging the company on the matter.In 2018, about 10 families were resettled on one-acre plots,\r\nleaving 25 others in the camp.

The size of the river makes it impossible to go through the river to the other side,” he said.\nThe poor state of the bridge puts their lives at risk as they go about their daily activities, Kimani noted, adding that their attempts to reach out to the local leadership for help have been futile.\nKimani said the neglect from the county and national governments has left them to their own means.\n“It has been very challenging for us yet we have leaders. Without this bridge, the economy of our village is badly devastated. We need to sell and buy farm produce and other commodities.”\nThe bridge was first put up in 2020, when a resident helped them make a metallic bridge, but it was wrecked by heavy floods the same year.\n“This bridge connects Mathioya and Kiharu constituencies. Since the metallic one was destroyed by rains, we have been remaking it with logs and risking our lives as we cross it daily,” he added.\nThe residents were reprieved when another well-wisher facilitated them to establish gabions to support the makeshift bridge and sustain it through the coming rain season.\nDickson Muiruri from Njathi Mwinga Foundation said they helped the villagers establish six gabions to safeguard their lives.\n“It would be unfortunate if this bridge collapses and causes loss of life,” he said.\nOne of the locals, Richard Thuo, said the gabion will support the bridge as they await more help from the government.\nHe observed that the bridge will still not last, challenging both levels of government to come in and help them.\n“This hanging bridge provides the help we need now but it’s only temporary. If we can get a bigger bridge that can be used by motorbikes, it would be very helpful to us,” Thuo said.\nHe added that the villagers are apprehensive especially when children use the makeshift bridge due to the risk of falling into the river.\nTo access any social activities across the river, they are forced to walk for hours to access the village, Thuo told journalists.\n“When we have burial ceremonies, the delegation cannot use this flimsy bridge. We also don’t trust it enough to use it in large groups,” he added.\nChildren attending the nearby Kambara Secondary School from the neighbouring Kiharu constituency also face difficulties accessing the school.\nAlice Muthoni said, “I had a son schooling at Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga Secondary, and eventually, I was forced to get him alternative accommodation because it's too dangerous to cross the river when it rains.”\nShe said many of the locals have ventured into French beans farming along the river bank, but transporting them to Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga shopping centre  – where buyers pitch camp – has been a tall order.\nCarrying bulky luggage such as fodder is also difficult because the hanging bridge is too narrow.",

    "content": "Evalyne Laipon displays traditional seeds /ALICE WAITHERA\nA transformative digital crop variety catalogue has been launched in the latest bid to enhance access to improved seeds.\nAnnouncing the launch of the African Digital Crop Variety catalogue, Agra called on governments, seed companies, researchers and development partners to adopt and contribute towards making it a living tool for the continent’s agricultural resilience and prosperity\n“The digital seed catalogue is an important milestone to strengthen the seed market and therefore further scale high-yielding and nutrient-dense seed access by smallholder farmers,” said Jonathan Said, vice president, Centre for Technical Expertise, at Agra.\nThe Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa is an organisation focused on scaling agricultural innovations that help smallholder farmers towards increased incomes, better livelihoods and improved food security.\nThe African-led institution developed the catalogue in partnership with ministries of agriculture, the National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) and national regulatory authorities across six countries.\nThe catalogue provides the first comprehensive, interactive and searchable database of released crop varieties for the initial cohort comprising Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.\nDespite hundreds of improved crop varieties being developed and released in Africa over the last decade, no single, up-to-date platform existed where governments, NARS, seed companies and other stakeholders, including non-governmental and farmer organisations, could access comprehensive information on available varieties.\nThe digital catalogue addresses long-standing challenges in seed system development, particularly the fragmentation, outdatedness and limited accessibility of national crop variety lists.\nAlice Ruhweza, president of Agra, said, “In many African countries, vital data on crop varieties is incomplete, inaccessible, or absent altogether.”\n“This has hindered farmers from accessing resilient, climate-smart and nutrient-dense crop varieties. The Africa Digital Crop Variety catalogue fills this critical gap by offering a centralised and transparent digital resource,” she added.\nThis innovation is developed through the Centre of Excellence for Seed Systems in Africa, Agra’s one-stop platform for advancing seed systems on the continent.\nCessa offers an integrated suite of tools, training, data, analysis and digital solutions aimed at ensuring equitable access to high-quality seed for farmers.\nThe digital catalogue is a milestone in the implementation of recommendations of the Seed Investment Plan, a blueprint for advancing seed systems in Africa.\nThe absence of such a platform hampered compliance, seed quality and certification processes and investments in seed systems, resulting in low adoption rates and a huge seed gap.\nFurthermore, the gap in information disproportionately affects women and young people, who often lack the networks and resources to access knowledge and business opportunities in seed systems.\nDr Jane Ininda, Cessa’s interim director, emphasised the platform’s importance.\n“This platform is not just a digital catalogue – it is a game-changer for seed sector transparency, equity, and growth,” Ininda said.\n“By consolidating variety data from across the continent, we're enabling smarter investment, research prioritisation and ultimately, improved livelihoods for farmers.”\nAgra has been working on seed systems for 20 years, developing robust seed businesses and enabling better policies that support advanced seed systems.\nThe organisation’s impact on Africa’s seed systems is enormous through a significant contribution to the release of 688 crop varieties and the strengthening of 114 African seed companies. Together with the empowerment of 38,000 agro-dealers, this is supporting 33 million farmers to access high-yielding seed.\nThe catalogue significantly improves agriculture and seed systems across Africa by providing an up-to-date, comprehensive list of officially released crop varieties from multiple countries.\nIts searchable, user-friendly interface serves breeders, regulators, seed companies and policymakers, enabling quick access to detailed data that supports commercialisation and better decision-making in variety choices, seed production, selection and marketing.\nAnchored by the findings of Agra’s Seed Systems Assessment Tool (SeedSAT) and the Seed investment plans and report of the Seed System Performance Index (SSPI) – which was adopted by the African Union as a continental benchmark – the new platform reflects Agra’s commitment to actionable, data-driven reforms in Africa’s agricultural transformation.\nThe platform promotes inclusivity by engaging both local and national seed stakeholders, strengthening grassroots participation.",

He was being a productive member of the society and was\r\nstill killed,” she said.\nMacharia’s burial was attended by hundreds of youths\r\ncarrying the Kenyan flag and who also draped his coffin in a flag.\nThey sang the national anthem and chanted other songs,\r\nexpressing their anger and condemning his murder.\nLeaders led by Kirinyaga Senator Kamau Murango called on the\r\ngovernment to reign in on police officers found culpable of shooting youths\r\nduring protests.\nMurango said the county lost four youths, most of whom did\r\nnot participate in the protests and who were at the height of their\r\nproductivity.\nLast week, two other youths, James Muriithi and Edwin Murimi, were laid to rest after suffering gunshot wounds during the protests.\n“Today we’re burying Macharia, tomorrow we will bury\r\nJackline Wawira, 20, who was shot while watching the protests in a balcony in\r\nGithurai,” he said.\nBut Murango appealed to Gen Zs to ensure they register as\r\nvoters in large numbers to ensure they make the changes they desire in the next\r\nelections.\n“Voting is the only way you can exercise your power to pick the\r\nleaders you want,” the senator told the residents.\nThe leaders hit back at President William Ruto for what they\r\ntermed as shifting the blame of the chaos experienced during protests to\r\nparents.\nThe President, during a church service at Africa Inland\r\nChurch last Sunday, told parents to stop abdicating their parental\r\nresponsibilities to other institutions such as the church and the state, saying\r\nit’s their responsibility to nurture and mentor their children.\nBut Baragwi MCA David Mathenge said some of the killed youth\r\nwere not participating in any chaos when they lost their lives and wondered why\r\npolice officers still shot at them.\n“You tell us that we have abdicated our parental duties but\r\nthings worsened when your Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen gave\r\nthe shoot-to-kill order,” he said.\n“You then came out and gave the shoot-on-the-legs order. If\r\nwe shoot all our youths on the legs, who will vote for you in 2027?” he asked.\nHis Kerugoya counterpart Eric Muchina insisted that parents\r\nhave not failed in their responsibilities, asking the President to instead rein\r\nin his errant juniors that he said are fanning the chaos.\nMuchina also took issue with the charges preferred against\r\nyouths arrested after the protests saying they will make it impossible for them\r\nto contribute to the growth of the economy.\n“We need to stop branding our youths as terrorists when\r\nthey’re just trying to mould their lives,” he added, highlighting the need for\r\nthe government to find amicable means of resolving the challenges faced by the\r\nyouths.\nMutira MCA Kinyua Wangui said those involved in Macharia’s\r\nshooting should be held accountable, saying the families affected by the\r\nmurders need justice.\nINSTANT ANALYSIS\nMacharia was allegedly shot while picking tea near his\r\nfamily’s home in Njogu-ini village in Kagumo with mourners demanding answers on\r\nhis death.

This is aimed at preventing losses and sustainably increasing productivity to enhance resilience to climate change,” Williams said.\nThe project will target six priority value chains: dairy, poultry, coffee, tea, fruit trees and African leafy vegetables.\nIt will support technology transfer and scaling of adaptation and mitigation practices across production, harvesting, processing and marketing stages.\nHe added that the project will be implemented in LREB’s 14 counties, with county officials identifying value chains most relevant to their communities and outlining intervention strategies. Victor Nyagaya, CEO of LREB, pointed out the vulnerability of the region’s predominantly agriculture-based workforce to the impacts of climate change.\n“72 percent of the workforce here depends on agriculture.

I can direct a colleague during surgery from anywhere in the world, whether it's Nairobi, the UK, or South Africa,” he explained.\n“You can see everything clearly, give precise instructions, and even follow the surgeon’s hand movements as if you're right there in the room.”\nThe integration of this platform is expected to significantly reduce the need for physical transfers of staff for mentorship or patient referrals.\nJunior doctors can now handle complex procedures with confidence, thanks to real-time support from senior consultants located elsewhere.\n“In the past, we had to send our team to Nairobi to carry out some operations alongside senior surgeons. Today, we can do the same surgeries right here in Kisumu, with expert guidance streamed directly into our theatre,” Bitta said.\nThe Proximie system prioritises patient privacy and data security.\nIt automatically removes identifying details from all footage, including names on scans or distinguishing features such as tattoos.\nFurthermore, consent is mandatory for any procedure to be streamed, and all video data is stored securely on JOOTRH’s institutional cloud.\nIndividuals are not allowed to download or share the content.\nThe initial rollout involves a cross-functional team of surgical residents, theatre nurses, biomedical engineers, technicians and IT staff.\nTheatre 4’s lead technician is overseeing the technical implementation, supported by James Ndung’u, the national coordinator for Proximie in Kenya.\nFor now, live sessions are limited to JOOTRH’s internal theatre classroom to give staff adequate time to familiarise themselves with the system.\nWeekly surgeries are planned for Mondays and Tuesdays, depending on patient availability and consent.\nAmong the first to receive hands-on training is Dr Corazon Deya, who joins the growing team of clinicians at JOOTRH embracing digital transformation in surgical practice.\nThe hospital hopes that once fully adopted, the platform will be extended to other theatres and used in collaborations beyond its walls.\nBy integrating smart technology into its surgical care model, JOOTRH continues to position itself as a leader in innovation and healthcare excellence in Western Kenya.\nInstant Analysis\nThe launch of the Proximie platform at JOOTRH marks a major leap in surgical care and training in Western Kenya. It allows real-time, remote surgical guidance and education, enabling junior doctors to perform complex procedures with expert support from anywhere in the world. This reduces patient referrals, boosts surgeon confidence, and enhances medical training. With strong data privacy safeguards and internal training underway, JOOTRH is now part of a growing network of hospitals embracing digital innovation in healthcare delivery.",

    "content": "Kisumu is stepping up its commitment to ending sexual and gender-based violence through strengthened partnerships between the justice system, civil society and county leadership.\nIn a roundtable convened by the Kenya Medical and Education Trust (KMET) in partnership with Equality Now, members of the Kisumu Court Users Committee (CUC) gathered to explore practical ways of enhancing access to justice and services for SGBV survivors.\nThe session brought together key stakeholders, including judges, magistrates, civil society organisations, county officials, led by Governor Anyang Nyong'o, and community representatives to assess the challenges survivors face and to craft a coordinated survivor-centred response.\n“This dialogue gave us a critical platform to unpack the barriers to justice—delays, stigma, and lack of proper support—and to build solutions that also strengthen prevention,” KMET chief executive officer Dr Monica Ogutusaid.\nShe said KMET has developed a community-to-court referral intervention that integrates paralegals, health workers, police gender desks, and court systems, ensuring survivors are not lost in bureaucratic processes.\nOgutu emphasised the need for community sensitisation to break the silence and stigma often associated with reporting such cases.\n“In the past, many cases were resolved in unofficial forums. Today, survivors are increasingly seeking justice, thanks to growing awareness,” she said.\nA key milestone in these efforts was the removal of fees for the P3 form—a vital document used in prosecuting SGBV cases.\n“It used to cost Sh1,500, then Sh1,000. Today, it’s free because of our advocacy,” Dr Ogutu added.\nJustice Hellen Omondi, president of the International Association of Women Judges (Kenya Chapter), highlighted the emotional toll such cases take on survivors and judicial officers.\n“Survivors often unintentionally destroy evidence—such as by bathing—because of shame or lack of knowledge. Fear of backlash and stigma further complicate the pursuit for justice,” she said.\nJustice Omondi said there is growing momentum to establish specialised SGBV courts, and called for mental health support for judicial officers constantly exposed to traumatic testimonies.\nKisumu gender, culture and sports executive Beatrice Odongo announced that the Gender Mainstreaming and Equality Bill has been passed by the county assembly and will soon be gazetted.\n“This bill ensures that women and men are equally recognised across all sectors—from economic empowerment to leadership and justice,” she said.\nThe county has also repurposed a safe house and is collaborating with partners to build a second shelter in Kisumu East.\nChief magistrate Dickson Onyango expressed his appreciation for the collaborative efforts spearheaded by Equality Now and KMET in addressing SGBV.\nOnyango said such forums are crucial in fostering a coordinated approach to handling SGBV cases.\n“It’s through these efforts that we can come up with practical solutions to the challenges we face,” he said, adding that survivors often encounter delays and stigma when seeking justice.\nOne of the key outcomes of the engagement, Onyango said, is the collective agreement on clear timelines to prevent retraumatisation of victims during the judicial process.\n“We have agreed that each stakeholder must play their part. If it’s the police, they must ensure files are processed and submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) promptly. The ODPP should then review and make a charging decision immediately,” he explained.\nOnce a case is in court, magistrates are encouraged to fast-track hearings, sometimes within two days, to minimise threats to witnesses and reduce the chances of victims withdrawing their statements.\n“Through this initiative, we are now aligning our efforts to ensure that all cases whether involving children or adults are expedited to deliver justice swiftly and protect survivors.\nEquality Now’s Judy Gitau commended Kisumu’s reviewed SGBV policy and called for continued focus on survivor-friendly court processes.\nGovernor Nyong’o, who addressed the meeting, underscored the county’s commitment:\n“We remain committed to ensuring a fair, accessible and timely justice system for all,” he said.\nDespite the progress, stakeholders emphasised the importance of including boys and men in the fight against SGBV.\n“We must grow together. Empowering one gender and leaving the other behind creates tension. Let’s bring men and boys on board,” Dr Ogutu urged.\nAs Kisumu county strengthens its coordinated response, stakeholders agree: the fight against SGBV must be inclusive, survivor-centred, and grounded in justice for all.",

Opening it up for goods, services and people is a forward-thinking move that will benefit everyone involved,” he said.\nThe governor reiterated that the immigration shift is a victory not just for Kenya, but for the entire continent.\n“Let this be the beginning of a continental wave.

    "content": "County governments have been urged to prioritise youth empowerment in the agricultural sector by allocating adequate resources to agribusiness in their annual development plans.\nThis call comes as concerns grow over the limited support for youth-led farming ventures despite agriculture being one of the key drivers of employment and economic growth in Kenya.\nSpeaking during a youth training forum organised by the Siaya County Youth Network in Bungoma onWednesday, John Mukenya, an Agricultural and climate change advocate, lamented the inadequate budgetary support for agribusiness in Bungoma County.\nHe noted that after reviewing the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) 2025/2026, it became evident that Bungoma County has not committed sufficient funding to promote youth participation in agriculture.\n“The review of the CIDP clearly shows that Bungoma County has overlooked youth agribusiness. There is very little commitment when it comes to financing programs that can uplift young farmers,” Mukenya said.\nHe added, “If we want to tackle youth unemployment, we must invest in agribusiness. Agriculture is not just farming, it’s a full economic value chain,”\nIn addition, Mukenya disclosed that the Bungoma County government had only allocated  Sh900 million towards the entire agriculture sector in the 2025/26 budget, a figure he termed insufficient considering the challenges facing farmers and youth agripreneurs in the region.\n“You can’t expect transformation in agriculture if your budget does not reflect that vision. Youths want to venture into poultry, dairy farming, and value addition, but they lack support structures,” Mukenya added.\nHe further criticized the county’s focus on maize production at the expense of other high-value crops that could generate better returns and encourage youth participation.\n“It’s like the county government is obsessed with maize. Every year, they distribute maize seeds and fertilisers, yet they ignore other promising value chains like soybeans, millet, sorghum, avocados, and sim sim,” he observed.\n“Young people are innovative. If supported, they can transform these value chains into profitable agribusiness ventures.”\nMukenya emphasized the need to diversify agricultural investments, noting that farmers, especially the youth, need options beyond traditional crops.\nHe also challenged county leaders to create a more inclusive agricultural strategy that accommodates youth ideas and modern farming practices.\nAs part of their training sessions, the youth participants developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) outlining key demands and recommendations to be submitted to the Bungoma County Department of Agriculture, Livestock and Cooperatives.\nThe MoU aims to push for deliberate inclusion of youth needs in policy and budgeting processes.\n“We are not just talking; we have prepared an MoU that will be formally presented to the County Executive Committee Member (CEC) for Agriculture,” Mukenya said.\nPhelgona Odipo, a field officer, Siaya County Youth Network, revealed that the youth training was part of a broader programme funded by GIZ aimed at enhancing the participation of young people in governance and agriculture.\n“Our project is currently running in six counties Siaya, Kisumu, Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga, and Busia,” Odipo explained.\nShe added, “We are working directly with youth groups and individuals interested in the agricultural sector,”\nShe added that the programme focuses on capacity building, equipping youth with skills in advocacy, budget analysis and engagement with county governments.\n“Through these sessions, we have been able to educate youth on the budget-making process and their right to participate,” she said.\nOdipo highlighted the importance of recognizing agriculture as a viable source of employment for young people, stressing the need for counties to go beyond token participation.\n“Youth need to see agriculture as a business, not a fallback plan,” she said. “If given access to credit, land, training and markets, they can run successful agribusinesses that uplift their communities,”",

    "content": "Tiriki Council of Elders chairperson Samson Imbukwa, Kaimosi Friends University VC Prof Peter Mwita and cultural custodian Thomas Ingara address the press at Kaimosi Friends University /HILTON OTENYO\nIn a groundbreaking move aimed at safeguarding indigenous\r\nheritage, Kaimosi Friends University has signed an MoU with the Tiriki Council\r\nof Elders for the establishment of a cultural centre.\nThe Tiriki Cultural Centre is dedicated to the preservation,\r\nresearch and promotion of Tiriki traditions.\nThe cultural centre will focus on the Tiriki subtribe of the\r\nLuhya community, the natives of Hamisi subcounty in Vihiga county where the\r\nuniversity is located.\nThe initiative seeks to address the urgent need to protect\r\nendangered customs, knowledge systems and sacred sites increasingly threatened\r\nby modernity and cultural erosion.\nAccording to the agreement, the centre will serve as a hub\r\nfor language preservation, oral storytelling, traditional ecological knowledge,\r\nindigenous healing practices and intergenerational learning. It will also\r\nsupport academic research and community-based conservation efforts within and\r\naround the university.\nSpeaking during the signing ceremony, Kaimosi Friends\r\nUniversity Vice Chancellor Prof Peter Mwita underscored the value of culture in\r\nshaping identity, nurturing community resilience and promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\n“The centre will offer a space for both learning and\r\nresearch around Tiriki customs while also promoting environmental\r\nconservation,” Prof Mwita said, adding that, “As a university, we are committed\r\nnot only to academic excellence but to meaningful community engagement.”\nMwita added that the university also plans to restore\r\ndegraded areas of the Kaimosi Forest, a sacred ecological zone intimately tied\r\nto Tiriki spirituality and rites of passage.\n“We will plant traditional trees, herbs and medicinal plants\r\naround the centre to support both sustainability and research into indigenous\r\nhealing systems,” he said.\nPreserving sacred knowledge and ritual spaces\nThe deal has been hailed by Tiriki elders as a long-awaited\r\nlifeline for their endangered heritage.Council chairperson Samson Imbukwa said the agreement\r\nsignals hope for the future of their traditions.\n“We have watched our culture erode year after year. This\r\npartnership assures us that the ways of our forefathers will not vanish,”\r\nImbukwa said.\nCultural custodian Thomas Ingara described the initiative as\r\n“a beacon of hope,” noting that the community's sacred sites within Kaimosi\r\nForest face increasing threats, including neglect and encroachment.\n“These shrines are not just cultural symbols they are sacred\r\nshelters used during the months-long traditional circumcision rites,” Ingara said.\n“Unfortunately, some community members, especially those\r\nliving outside Hamisi, have abandoned our customs and opted for hospital\r\ncircumcision under Western influence.”\nIngara warned that the increasing adoption of foreign\r\npractices risks severing younger generations from their roots and undermining\r\nthe values embedded in traditional ceremonies.\n“Western culture is a major threat to our identity. If we\r\ndon’t act now, future generations will never know where they came from,” he\r\nadded.\nThe Kaimosi Forest, part of the centre’s restoration and\r\nconservation strategy, is not only ecologically significant but also\r\nspiritually sacred to the Tiriki people. It houses numerous forest shrines used\r\nduring communal circumcision seasons — one of the most important and public\r\ntraditions of the community.\nThese sites, while off-limits to outsiders due to their\r\nsacred status, have in recent years attracted cultural tourism, research\r\ninterest and conservation partnerships.\nThe forest is also a repository of indigenous medicinal\r\nherbs used in traditional healing, particularly during initiation rites.\n“Many of the herbs used during circumcision and for treating\r\nvarious ailments originate from this forest. Their continued existence depends\r\non active protection and reforestation,” Mwita said.\nThe Tiriki community, working closely with the university,\r\nis advocating for a hybrid conservation model — one that combines scientific\r\nresearch with traditional ecological knowledge to develop a sustainable forest\r\nmanagement plan.\nThe university is currently seeking funding and technical\r\nsupport from both governmental and non-governmental partners to operationalise\r\nthe centre, expand research initiatives and support infrastructure development.\n“This is not just a cultural project. It is a social,\r\nenvironmental and educational investment in our future,” Mwita said.\nInstant Analysis\nThe Tiriki subtribe stands out among the Luhya for its\r\nstrict adherence to traditions — especially public, ritual circumcision\r\nceremonies, which have for generations formed the backbone of their cultural\r\nidentity. These practices attract both researchers and tourists, eager to learn\r\nabout the community’s way of life. However, the influence of modernity,\r\nparticularly among younger generations and diaspora members, has seen a steady\r\nshift toward hospital-based circumcision, threatening the continuity of these\r\ndeeply rooted customs.The MoU signed with Kaimosi Friends University is a\r\nstrategic lifeline. It promises not only to preserve intangible cultural\r\npractices but also to restore the degraded Kaimosi Forest, which is central to\r\nthe community's medicinal, spiritual, and ecological well-being. If successful,\r\nthe Tiriki Cultural Centre could become a national model for how traditional\r\ncommunities and modern institutions can work together to protect Kenya’s rich\r\nheritage from extinction.",

Out of the 177.2 million doses produced during that period, the country exported 11.3 million doses.\n“When we went to Paris for the World Health Organization meeting, I made sure I pointed out that Kenya is an animal vaccines producer. Since then, I have received many calls from people who want to buy vaccines from us,” Kagwe said.\n“As you know, Kevevapi is an animal vaccine producer and one of the very few in the African continent. We are very proud that we export many vaccines to many countries. Most of them have been in Africa, but increasingly outside the continent and this is an important and very strategic institution for Kenya because without it we will not be able to secure animals in our nation.”\nOther key proposals outlined in the roadmap include plans to upgrade the institute’s facilities to align with global manufacturing standards.\nThe CS noted that it will not only boost production capacity but also enhance the country’s capability to combat foot and mouth disease, lumpy skin disease, and Peste des Petits Ruminants, which are major contributors of livestock losses and economic disruption.\n“The demand for vaccines globally is going up because of the insistence by most of the consumers to know that the animals they are eating are healthy. And this is one of the reasons we have embarked on a mass vaccination campaign to ensure that Kenya is declared one of the countries that are disease free in the next three years, so that the importers of our livestock can do so knowing that they are safe and secure not just for food but also for sustenance in their own countries,” Kagwe said.\nThe CS dismissed allegations that the inoculations currently being used for the mass vaccination exercise in the country are donations from Bill Gates.\nHe said Kenya produces its own animal vaccines and it would therefore make no sense for the country to import.\n“There was propaganda about the source of our vaccines that they were donated to us by an American tycoon. That is not true. The truth of the matter is that Kenya is an exporter of vaccines. We export foot and mouth disease vaccines to other parts of the continent, so it would not make sense for us to say that we are importing the vaccines while at the same time exporting.”\nSpeaking at the same event, Livestock Development PS Jonathan Mueke lauded the institute for unveiling a strategic plan that is aligned with the government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda on enhancing food security and nutrition.\nMueke  pledged to support the institution to realise the ambitious plan.",

He was hosted by speaker Kevin Katisya.\nThe county chief said the sabotage was perpetrated by individuals acting at the behest of political detractors and development saboteurs wishing to deny beneficiaries access to piped water.\n“I therefore call upon members of the public, local administrators, and the security agencies to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activities or individuals to the relevant authorities for swift, lawful action.”\nMalombe said since he assumed office on August 25, 2022, his administration had made substantive and transformative strides in advancing the development agenda of  Kitui County.\nThe achievements revolved around the implementation of the county’s life-changing projects, programmes, policies, and strategic initiatives to enhance healthcare, access to clean water, road connectivity and food and nutrition security, among others.\n“I am pleased to report that, in just two years and 10 months, my government has implemented a total of 1,921 infrastructural projects and programmes in all the 40 wards and 247 villages of our county,” Malombe said.\nHe pointed out that 989 of the projects were implemented under the Community Level Infrastructure Development Programme, an initiative that was conceptualised during his first term.\nThe CLIDP initiative he added was meant to ensure equitable development, poverty alleviation and improvement of livelihoods.\nMalombe disclosed that in efforts to reduce the distance to water points, his administration had installed and rehabilitated 134km of water pipeline extensions.\nNoting that the real challenge in Kitui was not water scarcity but rather limited accessibility, the governor said his administration had prioritised the construction of sump-wells and sand dams.\n“Notably, a single sump-well has the capacity to yield approximately 200,000 litres of water,” he said, adding that they are cost-effective, reliable and sustainable water solutions.\nMalombe said 19 sump wells serving over 5,000 households were done across the county.

    "content": "It is dusty in this part of the country this season. In the near-moderate heat, 29-year-old Lydia Njeri Mwaura bends to mop her floor.\nTidying up after serving a client. Her back straightens, and she looks at us, beaming, “Karibu, Karibu,” she calls joyfully.\nIn the quiet Chaaria market in Mwanganthia ward, Meru County, Njeri, an agripreneur, is making significant investments in her wet milling business, which integrates porridge vending, cereals retailing, and the sale of blended flours, earning a weekly profit of Sh100,000.\nNjeri, a proud mother of two, operates a hive of enterprises that deliver much-needed support in value addition to various agricultural value chains.\n“My responsibility is to improve the standard of the cereals grown in Chaaria, which includes pearl millet, finger millet, green grams, cow peas, and groundnuts by milling and giving them numerous usages,” said Njeri.\nFrom her rented premises in Chaaria Market, which serves as both a milling hub and porridge café, she operates a wet milling machine (locally known as Kithii kia ucuru).\n“In our milling business, we focus on value addition by wet milling pearl millet and finger millet using a machine known as ‘Kithii.’ We blend the two grains to produce porridge, which we serve on-site and also deliver to customers who place external orders,” she explained.\nAccording to reports, pearl millet and finger millet are highly nutritious and packed with proteins, vitamins, antioxidants, and essential minerals like calcium, iron, and zinc.\nThe porridge made from these grains is especially favoured by the elderly, people with diabetes, children, and pregnant or lactating mothers.\nRich in dietary fibre and complex carbohydrates, the porridge provides sustained energy, supports blood and bone health through its iron and calcium content, and offers plant-based protein for muscle maintenance.\nThe Bachelor of Science in Agriculture graduate began her entrepreneurial journey in 2021 after losing her job when the company she worked for collapsed due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“Setting up the business was a struggle because I didn’t have enough money. I secured a loan of Sh200,000 from a friend and purchased the porridge milling machine and a stock worth Sh5000 that has supported me to date,” said Njeri.\r\n\r\nHer innovation extended to formulating \"Uji Power,\" a fortified porridge made from a nutrient-rich blend of cassava, arrowroot, groundnuts, and milk.\nThe porridge gained popularity for its health benefits and taste, significantly increasing her customer base. \r\nDespite a tough start with little to no customers, she found a way to break into the market.\n“I began hawking porridge as a strategic marketing move to create awareness about my new wet milling business. The goal was to attract more customers by also promoting the health benefits of the nutritious porridge in the market,” she stated.\nFor Njeri, innovation flows like a well-tended stream. Using her unique milling machine, lined with a traditional clay interior that guarantees a smooth, porridge-perfect blend, similar to traditional stone milling, she not only produces nutrient-rich flour but also harvests a treasured by-product: pearl millet residue.\nThis coarse, raw delicacy is naturally rich in calcium and has found a special place among pregnant mothers, who now cherish it as a wholesome alternative to the stones found on supermarket shelves and kiosks.\n“It’s our very own traditional super snack,” Njeri remarked with pride. “Our foremothers handed this down to us during their stone-milling days, rubbing millet between rocks to create the perfect porridge flour. I encourage expectant mothers to embrace it and share it with their children because it's as pure and natural as it gets.”\nNjeri utilises the nutritious residue to feed her poultry and sells the surplus to other poultry farmers, thereby creating an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nThe business saw a breakthrough in 2024 after she enrolled in the Drought Tolerant Crops for Youth Jobs Creation Program, implemented by Africa Harvest Biotech Foundation International (the lead partner),  International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation.\nThe training equipped her with vital business skills, resulting in improved operations and expanded services.\r\n\r\n“In 2021, we made around Sh 35,000 a week. Now, we are averaging Sh100,000 weekly, thanks to the training and restructuring of our services,” she says.\r\n\r\nDetermined to apply her newly acquired knowledge, she leased half an acre of land and began growing sorghum, thereby reducing the cost of purchasing raw materials for wet milling.\nHer first harvest yielded four 90kg bags, all of which were used in her milling business. She attributes part of her success to the program, which provides quality, improved seed as an incentive.\r\n\r\nSince joining the program in March 2024, Njeri has employed two staff members, 27-year-old Ruth Wairimu and 24-year-old Elosy Mukiri, further scaling her impact and creating employment for young people.\nWith improved earnings, she purchased a plot worth Sh800,000, which she plans to use to grow some of the cereals she currently sources externally. She says this will reduce operational costs and increase profit margins, as she won’t need to buy all the cereals she uses.\r\n\r\nHowever, Njeri conceded to various challenges she has endured in the business and called for both government and non-government interventions to empower more young people and women in business.\nShe urges the government to reduce the cost of business licenses. She calls for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors to provide quality seeds and inputs for smallholder farmers.\nSince launching her business, Njeri has been paying an\r\nannual business permit fee of Sh3,000. However, in the 2023/24 financial year,\r\nthe amount increased to Sh4,000, a cost she urges the Meru County government to\r\nreconsider for the sake of unemployed youth looking to venture into business.\r\nIn total, she spends Sh7,200 on medical certificates and Sh4,000 on the\r\nbusiness permit annually, costs she considers unfair for the survival of small\r\nbusinesses.\n“The government should consider consolidating the different levies into one fair amount to encourage more youth to venture into business,” she said.\nAccording to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report, in Kenya, micro, small and medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are vital to the economy, contributing approximately 40 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and offering employment to an estimated 14.9 million Kenyans.\nThe DTCs 4 Youth Job Creationprogram seeks to scale commercialisation of drought-tolerant\r\ncrops technologies tosecuredignified and fulfilling work for 120,000 young people in rural Kenya, 70 per cent of whom are young women.\r\n\r\nNjeri affirms the importance of empowering women, saying, “Empowering women ensures a stable family and society. When a woman is empowered, the whole community thrives.”\nTo the unemployed youth fresh from school, Njeri has encouraged them to take the bold step of starting low.\r\n\r\nShe recalled starting her business with just a five-litre can to vend the porridge, and that didn’t stop her from getting to where she is today.\r\n\r\n“No one should be afraid of starting a small business.\nStarting a porridge business requires little capital. Young people should try starting small if they can’t find a large amount to start a business,” she advised.\r\n\r\nThe general agriculture professional also expresses her pride over her business path, which she says operates in line with her profession.\r\n\r\nShe says the educated youth should not be discouraged by a lack of white collar jobs. They should instead narrow their skills and knowledge towards the SMEs that offer a brighter promise to the Kenyan youth.\nNjeri has attributed her success to her commitment she has rendered the job since the beginning. She noted that the majority of the Youth treat their job as a side source of income, hence ending up failing to accord their business the necessary attention it deserves.\n“The majority might think I am not utilising my university education that my parent gave me, but for me, I feel very okay, very comfortable working in this business. I took it as my main business and not as a side hustle,” she said.\nAccording to the World Bank, Kenya's unemployment rate stood at 5.6 per cent in 2023, reflecting a modest increase from 5.4 per cent in 2022.\r\nYouth unemployment remains a pressing concern, with 8.4 per cent of Kenyans aged 15–24 out of work.\nWhile the overall rate appears relatively low, the quality of employment is a significant issue only 10 per cent of the workforce holds formal jobs, leaving many in unstable, low-paying informal roles.\nNjeri hopes to extend her business by purchasing more flour milling machines to reduce the cost she incurs going to Meru town for flour milling.\nShe\r\nbelieves owning a flour mill will not only boost her income, but also save her\r\ncustomers the trouble of travelling to Meru town, which is about 18 kilometres away from Chaaria market.\n“I spend Sh400 on transport to Meru for flour milling, plus\r\nextra charges for the milling service,\" she explained. \"My goal is to purchase a\r\nflour milling machine within the next two years. It will be a more affordable\r\noption for customers in Chaaria, mostof\r\nwhom are farmers with easy access to cereals,” she noted.",

Full-fledged guarantees of the independence of anti-corruption\r\nagencies. Real opportunities to verify, so that any Russian interference is\r\nkept out.\n“Everyone who has access to state secrets, and this includes\r\nnot only NABU and SAPO, but also the SBI and the National Police, must undergo\r\nlie detector tests. These must be regular checks,” Zelensky said.\nUkraine has long been considered one of the most corrupt\r\ncountries in Europe.\nAllegations of corruption have been levelled against some of\r\nthe country’s top officials, including several close allies of the President,\r\nsuch as former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov.",

    "content": "Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka's vehicle, whose windscreen was smashed during a confrontation with the police in Kigumo, Murang'a.Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka has said he missed death by a whisker after police officers allegedly shot at his car.\nOne police officer, he claimed, had a huge stone that he smashed into his vehicle’s windscreen, damaging it and making it impossible for the driver to see.\n“Luckily, the driver swerved and just then, three bullets rang into the air, going through my vehicle. I was a target, and I believe that was an attempted assassination. I don’t know why anybody would want to eliminate me,” he claimed.\nWith the damaged windscreen, Munyaka further explained that the driver could not go fast and that the officers who were running after them eventually caught up with him, allegedly further destroying his vehicle, injuring his driver on the head.\nThe police, he added, were accompanied by masked men who he claimed had pistols, noting that the incident was unprecedented.\n“I have served under all the other presidents and I have never seen such violence. We came here under the invitation of the church and area MP,” he said, adding that the church event was planned long ago and that all opposition principals had sent representatives.\nArea MP Joseph Munyoro said the number of injured persons is yet to be established as most scampered in different directions when they were attacked.\nHe cautioned police officers against engaging in such\r\nillegal activities, saying they will be held responsible individually.\n“Those who attacked us know that it is a debt you\r\nhave put upon yourself. Whether it takes 20 years, you will be held\r\naccountable. We had not gone to anybody’s home. I represent Kigumo and cannot\r\nask the police for permission to talk to my people.”\nFormer area MP Jamleck Kamau, whose vehicle was also shot at\r\ntwice, said he was a victim of serious police brutality that almost claimed his\r\nlife.\n“If you look at where the bullet holes are positioned, you\r\nwill see they were not aiming at my feet, and they are on both sides of the\r\nvehicle. If I died today, what would you have told my children?” he asked.\nKamau alleged that a bodyguard to a local political leader\r\nfired the bullets that hit his car and underscored the need for police officers\r\nto be restrained from using unnecessary force.\nNyandarua senator John Methu also emphasised that police\r\nofficers used extreme force, saying he tried to engage the police officers to\r\nallow them to go home if they did not want them to address residents at\r\nKamukabi shopping centre.\n“They were trying to direct us to another road where more\r\ngoons were waiting for us, and when I tried to engage them to let us go home,\r\nthey lobbed teargas canisters at us,” Methu claimed.\n“The damage that our vehicles incurred has not been seen\r\nbefore. The force used on us was overt. Why would a police officer shoot at a\r\nvehicle in close range?” he wondered, adding that Kenyans have a right to\r\nassociate or dissociate with anybody.\nLawyer Ndegwa Njiru on his part called for local and\r\ninternational non-state actors to investigate the incident and ensure those\r\nresponsible are held accountable.\nHe confirmed that the matter was reported at the Gachocho police\r\npost, saying that they are now waiting to see if the police will investigate\r\nthe matter.\n“The people who attacked us, unfortunately, are police\r\nofficers. This is why we’re calling for international organisations to step in\r\nand save our democracy and constitution”.\nHe said some of the bullets fired at them have been\r\nrecovered and will be used to ensure the police officers involved are punished.\n“Tomorrow, we will meet and write a report to IPOA. It doesn’t\r\nmean that we will surrender the bullets to them because we also don’t trust\r\nthem”.",

    "summary": "China and Mauritania established diplomatic ties on July 19, 1965.\nOver the past six decades, \"friendship\" has been a defining theme of their partnership.",
    "content": "In early July, the familiar tune of Auld Lang Syne in Chinese echoed through a classroom at the Confucius Institute in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. Leading the chorus in Chinese was Li Mo, a teacher from China, guiding his students in a tribute to a friendship that transcends language and borders.\n\"Everyone here knows this song and its meaning,\" Li said. \"It perfectly symbolizes the enduring friendship between China and Mauritania.\"\nChina and Mauritania established diplomatic ties on July 19, 1965.\nOver the past six decades, \"friendship\" has been a defining theme of their partnership.\nSignature projects such as the Friendship Port, the Friendship Hospital, and the recently completed China-Mauritania Friendship Overpass stand as lasting symbols of this relationship.\nLocated on the Atlantic coast, the Autonomous Port of Nouakchott, also known as the Friendship Port, is considered the \"economic lung\" of Mauritania. Built by a Chinese company, the port began operations in 1986.\nBefore its construction, Mauritania lacked natural harbors and struggled with severe shortages of essential materials. European experts once deemed a deep-water port unfeasible. Its completion marked a milestone in the country's pursuit of economic independence\n\"Without the port, many national development plans would not have been possible,\" said Fayssal Beyrouk, adviser to the Director General of the Port Authority, who once studied port management in China. \"The deep-water port enabled the import of industrial equipment and essential goods, laying the foundation for our economic progress.\"\nThanks to continued Chinese support, the port has undergone several expansions. In 2024, its annual throughput reached 6.12 million tonnes, handling 230,000 twenty-foot containers, about 80 percent of the country's external trade.\n\"Today, the port not only serves Mauritania but is also emerging as a logistics hub for landlocked neighbors like Mali,\" said Ahmedou Mokhtar El Gayed, the port's commercial manager. \"A special economic zone is being planned within the port to support the oil and gas industry. None of this would be possible without strong Chinese support.\"\nAnother major infrastructure project, the China-Mauritania Friendship Overpass, was inaugurated in May this year. Built by a Chinese firm along National Road N2 in Nouakchott, the overpass has eased traffic congestion and become a popular local landmark.\nBeyond improving transport, the project created jobs. At its peak, 320 Mauritanian workers were employed. Chinese engineers trained local staff in key technical skills, including rebar work, surveying, and materials testing.\n\"Many of the local staff we trained were later recruited by other projects, a real recognition of their skills,\" said Zhang Huijie, head of the project's technical team.\nAhmedou Mokhtar El Gayed, the Friendship Port's commercial manager, looks at ships in the port in Nouakchott, Mauritania, June 19, 2025. (Xinhua/Si Yuan)\nCooperation in healthcare has also yielded significant results. Built with Chinese assistance in 2010, the Friendship Hospital is one of Nouakchott's largest public hospitals. Located in the Arafat district, it serves nearly 60 percent of the city's low- and middle-income residents.\n\"Our Chinese friends have given us tremendous support,\" said hospital director Mustafa Abdallahi. \"Beyond building the hospital, they continue to provide medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and technical assistance.\"\nSince 1968, China has sent 35 medical teams to Mauritania. More than 800 Chinese doctors and specialists have offered long-term services. The current team runs a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinic at the hospital, where acupuncture treatments for back, neck and joint pain have become increasingly popular.\nLiu Sijia, a member of the 35th Chinese medical team to Mauritania, performs acupuncture treatment on a patient at the Friendship Hospital in Nouakchott, Mauritania, Jan. 17, 2025. (Xinhua/Si Yuan)\n\"People line up for TCM consultations every time we open,\" said Liu Sijia, a member of the team. \"We also train local doctors to help spread this valuable knowledge.\"\nSpeaking to Xinhua, Chinese Ambassador to Mauritania Tang Zhongdong said that Mauritania has proposed branding more development projects as \"Friendship\" initiatives, an expression of mutual trust and deep-rooted goodwill.\n\"More 'Friendship' projects are on the way,\" Tang said. \"They will continue to elevate China-Mauritania relations to new heights.\"",

Don’t demand that we all hate him just because you do.”\nHe also challenged assumptions that those opposed to Ruto represent the majority. “You can bring your candidate, but let those who support the President have their voice too,” he added.\nAs Chair of the Council of Governors, Abdullahi praised the current administration’s handling of county funding, contrasting it with the previous regime.\n“In terms of both the amount and the timely release of money, we are better off today than we’ve ever been at the Council of Governors,” he said.\nHe further urged Kenyans to be wary of glorifying politicians who oppose the government. “Some of these people have nothing to offer, but Kenyans idolize them just because they’re critical,” he said.\nOn Friday, Raila Odinga defended Sifuna’s right to dissent, reaffirming that ODM remains a democratic party where open dialogue is encouraged.\n“I have not imposed any restrictions on speech within the party,” Odinga said, urging tolerance of differing views, including those critical of his own leadership.",

    "content": "Laikipia county, traditionally known for livestock rearing, is largely a dry region. However, this is changing as farmers venture into the cultivation of highly-priced coffee.\nAmidst the scorching sun, coffee bushes blossom on Peter Kimani’s farm in Tandare village within Kinamba ward.\nKimani, who has dedicated one and a quarter-acre of land to coffee farming, reveals he started in 2022 and, after making his first sale from the crop, has never looked back.\n“Maize has been our cash crop for many years but now it has been replaced by coffee due to the good returns. With an acre of maize crop making a net profit of Sh30,000 annually and the same piece of land planted with coffee earns Sh240,000, coffee is the best option,” the budding farmer said.\nHe added that sales have increased tremendously and he recently pocketed Sh320,000.\nWith unpredictable weather patterns in the county and coffee farming requiring an altitude of between 1000m and 2000m to grow well, Kimani, who has nearly a thousand Batian variety coffee bushes, said they rely on shallow rains and dams for farming.\nThe secretary of Ng’arua Coffee Farmers’ cooperative society explained they use portable machines to remove the red husk, then wash and dry the coffee for market.\n“Since we do not have a processing factory it’s upon the farmers to do their pulping and dry then we sell the produce as members of the society aimed to get good returns,” notes Kimani.\nA kilo of parchment fetches Sh330 while dried coffee sells for Sh200 at the New Kenya Planters Cooperative Union (NKPCU).\nHe points out that they discourage members from selling to brokers, aiming for farmers to benefit from the cooperative society through advance pay and training. The middlemen, from Nyeri, Kirinyaga and Nairobi counties, have been frequenting the area.\nKimani is among hundreds of farmers across the six wards—Sossian, Githiga, Marmanet, Igwamiti, Ol Moran and Ngobit—who have embraced top-rated coffee farming to improve their economic fortunes.\nThe county government has been at the forefront of sensitising farmers to venture into coffee farming, distributing seedlings in these six wards.\n“Our target in the next four years is to fetch sh10 billion from coffee farming and many families will be out of poverty through this venture. With an acreage of land under coffee, every family take home will be a million shillings,” Laikipia Governor Joshua Irungu said.\nCoffee farming will create job opportunities for the youth and, at the same time, there is a ready market for the produce, he said.\nIrungu pointed out that promoting coffee farming would help eradicate perennial conflicts between farmers and herders who graze their farms illegally during dry seasons since coffee bushes are not edible by livestock.\nThe state is keen on boosting coffee production and earnings. Since 1970, the country has been on the world map, earning billions of dollars in foreign currency from coffee production, whose farming has been dominant in central Kenya.\nBut with a decline in production and earnings, Cooperatives CS Wycliffe Oparanya, during a visit to Laikipia, said the government was employing a three-year plan to increase acreage under coffee.\nSome of the interventions include giving out coffee seedlings to farmers, training and marketing.\nNKPCU managing director, Timothy Mirugi, said Kenya produces 49 tonnes of coffee annually.\nDuring a drive to distribute 20,000 coffee seedlings to farmers in Kinamba, Mirugi said the government had an ambitious plan of attaining 200,000 tonnes by the year 2028.\nThis year alone, KPCU aims to give out 500,000 coffee seedlings to farmers in Laikipia. The county targets to grow 10 million coffee bushes by 2027.",

    "content": "Community health promoters form the backbone of primary healthcare workers in many rural areas.\nThey are charged with\r\nthe monumental task of delivering essential health services directly to\r\npeople’s homes, where they are often the first and only point of contact between\r\ncommunities and the health system.\nYet, their work is\r\nhampered daily by one of the most pressing but overlooked challenges in rural\r\nhealth service delivery; mobility.\nAcross the seven\r\nsubcounties in Busia, CHPs support more than 100 households each, often traveling\r\nan average of four kilometres on foot daily while carrying medical supplies\r\nand registers.\nThe terrain is tough,\r\nthe sun relentless, and the roads where they exist are often rough or\r\nimpassable.\nDuring emergencies,\r\nwhere every minute matters, these mobility barriers can mean the difference\r\nbetween life and death.\n“For years, CHPs have\r\nbeen trained, equipped with digital tools and provided stipends, but the most\r\nbasic need for transportation remained unmet,” a representative from World\r\nBicycle Relief said.\n“Their potential to\r\nserve communities was limited not by skills or willpower, but by how far their\r\nfeet could take them.”\nOn a quiet night in\r\nMarch, that challenge came to a head for Phaustine Omasete, a dedicated community health promoter in the Katotoi Community Unit of Teso North subcounty.\nAt 10 pm, there was a frantic\r\nknock on his door. Standing outside was a young couple in distress.\nThe 22-year-old woman\r\nhad suffered a miscarriage two weeks earlier and was experiencing severe,\r\nuncontrolled bleeding.\nShe needed urgent\r\nmedical care.\nOmaseteimmediately\r\nassessed the situation, calmed the couple, and issued a referral to Ang’urai health centre, the closest facility with emergency services. But time was not\r\non their side.\nJust weeks before,Omasetehad received a Buffalo Bicycle through a strategic partnership between World\r\nBicycle Relief, Living Goods and the county government of Busia.\nThat bicycle became\r\nthe lifeline. It was used to swiftly carry the woman to the health facility,\r\nwhere she received emergency treatment. The bleeding was controlled and by 1 am, they\r\nwere back home safe and alive.\n“That night showed me\r\nthe power of a bicycle,”Omaseterecalled.\n“Without the bicycle, I don’t know\r\nwhat would have happened.”\nHis story is\r\none of many emerging from across Busia county, where 350 Buffalo Bicycles have\r\nbeen distributed to 324 CHPs and 26 community health assistants (CHAs).\nThe goal is to\r\nstrengthen primary healthcare by improving reach, speed and service delivery\r\nin hard-to-reach communities.\nWith bicycles, CHPs\r\nare now reaching more households per day, conducting timely follow-ups, and\r\nresponding swiftly to emergencies.\nIn a region where\r\nmalaria remains a leading health challenge, mobility has also improved delivery\r\nof test kits and medications.\nAccording to Living\r\nGoods, CHPs currently handle 70 per cent of confirmed malaria cases directly at\r\nthe household level.\nThe Buffalo Bicycles,\r\nbuilt for rough terrain with reinforced frames and heavy-duty carriers are\r\ndesigned for durability.\nA network of trained\r\nlocal mechanics supports ongoing maintenance, ensuring sustainability beyond\r\ninitial distribution.\nWhile the\r\nintervention is modest in design, it is profound in impact. For CHPs, the\r\nbicycles reduce physical fatigue and eliminate costly transport expenses.\nFor patients, they\r\nbring health services closer sometimes just in time.\n“This is more than a\r\nlogistics solution. It’s about dignity, access and equitable care,” World\r\nBicycle Relief regional director Maureen Kolenyo said. \"When CHPs can move faster\r\nand farther, the whole system becomes more responsive.”\nEarly results from\r\nthe Busia programme are informing plans for scale-up across other counties.\nBy centering the\r\nneeds of community health workers and aligning with national health goals, the\r\nprogramme exemplifies a sustainable model of public-private collaboration.\nThe message from\r\nBusia is clear: mobility is not a luxury but a necessity in rural healthcare.\nWhether responding to\r\nemergencies at night or ensuring children receive timely malaria treatment,\r\nbicycles are helping CHPs close the distance between families and the health\r\nsystem.\nFor communities\r\nscattered across Kenya’s rural communities, these two wheels represent access,\r\nhope, and survival.\n“In my work, every\r\nminute counts,” said Omasete. “With this bicycle, I can save time and\r\nsometimes, I can save a life.”",

    "content": "The Kenya Leather Industrial Park, located at Kenanie, Machakos county, will be ready for operationalisation by December, marking a significant milestone in the country’s industrial transformation.Industry PS Juma Mukhwana confirmed its readiness to start operations by the end of the year during a tour of the facility on Wednesday.The park, developed jointly by the Kenya Leather Development Council and the Export Processing Zones Authority, is 70 per cent complete.The park’s development aligns with the government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, which identifies the leather industry as a priority area for job creation and value addition.“This is a major step in actualising the Beta agenda. The park will not only reduce the country’s dependency on imported leather products, like shoes, but also enable Kenya to tap into the estimated Sh175 billion market potential in the leather value chain. The park will help reduce imports of leather products, as they will now be produced locally,” he said.The PS encouraged investors to take up rental spaces in the park, noting the availability of warehouses ready to serve as tanneries and manufacturing facilities for finished leather products, complete with utilities such as water, electricity and internet. Ongoing infrastructure works, including roads and security, are also in progress.\"We are offering competitive and fair pricing for rental spaces and there are multiple advantages of operating within an Export Processing Zone as investors will enjoy tax holidays and duty remission on imported machinery for manufacturing,\" he said.These facilities, supported by essential infrastructure, position the park as a ready-to-go industrial hub for leather processing and manufacturing. This is expected to boost local manufacturing, cut import costs and create over 100,000 jobs, up from the current 17,000, once fully operational.Mukhwana, who also toured the Training and Production Centre for the Shoe Industry in Thika, urged KLDC to collaborate with institutions like the Kenya Industrial Training Institute to expand technical training in leather processing. He noted that the government was committed to supporting skills development through partnerships, equipment supply and teacher deployment.KLDC chief executive Issack Noor, who accompanied the PS during the inspection, said the facility  features a finalised common effluent treatment plant. He highlighted that Kenya produces approximately three million hides from large livestock and over 18 million skins from goats and sheep annually, a large portion of which is underutilised or exported unprocessed.“The leather industry has the potential to grow from generating Sh15 billion to Sh120 billion annually. With the establishment of this park, we aim to harness that value locally and even surpass Sh175 billion through full value-chain development,” Noor said.He emphasised the need to relocate tanneries into the park and invest in cleaner, efficient leather processing.The park’s design incorporates sustainability measures to ensure environmentally friendly processing.\"Leather processing is traditionally considered polluting, but with modern technologies in waste treatment and water recycling, we aim to make Kenanie a model of green industrialisation,\" he said.Noor also emphasised the importance of creating backward and forward linkages within the sector, from livestock farmers and abattoirs to logistics providers and exporters, so as to build a complete and efficient ecosystem for leather.\"The main product that contributes to leather is meat and leather can earn five times more value than meat if processed and marketed properly. We are wasting billions every year. That must end now,” he remarked.As demand for quality leather products continues to grow both locally and internationally, the Kenanie park is expected to serve as a catalyst for Kenya’s rise as a leather processing and manufacturing powerhouse in Africa.\nThe Kenya Leather Industrial Park, located at Kenanie, Machakos county, will be ready for operationalisation by December, marking a significant milestone in the country’s industrial transformation.\nIndustry PS Juma Mukhwana confirmed its readiness to start operations by the end of the year during a tour of the facility on Wednesday.\nThe park, developed jointly by the Kenya Leather Development Council and the Export Processing Zones Authority, is 70 per cent complete.\nThe park’s development aligns with the government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, which identifies the leather industry as a priority area for job creation and value addition.\n“This is a major step in actualising the Beta agenda.

The park will help reduce imports of leather products, as they will now be produced locally,” he said.\nThe PS encouraged investors to take up rental spaces in the park, noting the availability of warehouses ready to serve as tanneries and manufacturing facilities for finished leather products, complete with utilities such as water, electricity and internet. Ongoing infrastructure works, including roads and security, are also in progress.\n\"We are offering competitive and fair pricing for rental spaces and there are multiple advantages of operating within an Export Processing Zone as investors will enjoy tax holidays and duty remission on imported machinery for manufacturing,\" he said.\nThese facilities, supported by essential infrastructure, position the park as a ready-to-go industrial hub for leather processing and manufacturing. This is expected to boost local manufacturing, cut import costs and create over 100,000 jobs, up from the current 17,000, once fully operational.\nMukhwana, who also toured the Training and Production Centre for the Shoe Industry in Thika, urged KLDC to collaborate with institutions like the Kenya Industrial Training Institute to expand technical training in leather processing. He noted that the government was committed to supporting skills development through partnerships, equipment supply and teacher deployment.\nKLDC chief executive Issack Noor, who accompanied the PS during the inspection, said the facility  features a finalised common effluent treatment plant. He highlighted that Kenya produces approximately three million hides from large livestock and over 18 million skins from goats and sheep annually, a large portion of which is underutilised or exported unprocessed.\n“The leather industry has the potential to grow from generating Sh15 billion to Sh120 billion annually. With the establishment of this park, we aim to harness that value locally and even surpass Sh175 billion through full value-chain development,” Noor said.\nHe emphasised the need to relocate tanneries into the park and invest in cleaner, efficient leather processing.\nThe park’s design incorporates sustainability measures to ensure environmentally friendly processing.\n\"Leather processing is traditionally considered polluting, but with modern technologies in waste treatment and water recycling, we aim to make Kenanie a model of green industrialisation,\" he said.\nNoor also emphasised the importance of creating backward and forward linkages within the sector, from livestock farmers and abattoirs to logistics providers and exporters, so as to build a complete and efficient ecosystem for leather.\n\"The main product that contributes to leather is meat and leather can earn five times more value than meat if processed and marketed properly. We are wasting billions every year. That must end now,” he remarked.",

    "content": "Experts have advised Kenya to consider an improved drug\r\ncombination to treat malaria, following evidence that the disease-causing\r\nparasite is developing resistance to the drugs currently used in Kenya.\nThey proposed a combination of three drugs because if the\r\ncurrent two-drug therapy fails and there is no alternative, Kenya’s malaria\r\nstrategy could collapse.\n“Triple-ACTs combining lumefantrine with piperaquine or\r\namodiaquine could help maintain drug efficacy,” they said.\nExperts from the Kenya Medical Research Institute and Brown\r\nUniversity, US, made the recommendation after tracking the parasite’s\r\nresistance to malaria drugs in Kenya between 1998 and 2021, in the most\r\ncomprehensive such study in East Africa to date.\nKenya’s official first-line treatment for uncomplicated\r\nmalaria is Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL), a combination of two drugs: Artemether\r\n(a fast-acting drug derived from the sweet wormwood plant) and Lumefantrine, a\r\nlonger-acting drug that clears remaining parasites.\nKenya adopted AL in 2006, following World Health\r\nOrganization recommendations to switch from older drugs that the parasite had\r\nbecome resistant to (like chloroquine and SP).\n“Kenya may be ripe for artemisinin resistance spread with\r\nancillary mutations and the undermining of partner drugs,” the research done by\r\nKemri and its partner indicates.\nThe findings have been published on the preprint server\r\nMedRxiv, in a paper titled, “Two decades of molecular surveillance in Kenya\r\nreveal shifting Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance mutations linked to\r\nfrontline drug changes.”\nMalaria is spread through the bite of a female Anopheles\r\nmosquito infected with the plasmodium parasite.\nThe researchers analysed 642 blood samples from malaria\r\npatients across Kenya, collected between 1998 and 2021. They analysed parasites\r\nfound in the blood using powerful genetic tools, helping them track how the\r\nmalaria parasite has changed in response to Kenya’s shifting drug policies.\nThey found that after artemether-lumefantrine was adopted in\r\nKenya in 2006, mutations that help the parasite survive the drug began rising\r\nsharply.\n“Following the adoption of artemether-lumefantrine in 2006,\r\nwe observed a rapid expansion of MDR1 N86N, Y184F, and D1246D alleles\r\nassociated with reduced lumefantrine susceptibility,” the researchers observed.\nKenya’s national malaria treatment strategy has changed\r\nmultiple times in the past 25 years, but the new findings suggest the parasite\r\nhas kept up and sometimes even anticipated new treatments before they came.\n“These findings\r\ndemonstrate the rapid and dynamic evolution of drug resistance in response to\r\nshifting antimalarial drug pressures,” the scientists said. “They underscore\r\nthe need for sustained genomic surveillance in malaria-endemic regions to\r\ninform adaptive treatment strategies.”\nCurrently, no country deploys the proposed three-drug\r\ncombination – known as Triple Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapies (TACTs)\r\n-as standard first-line malaria treatment. Instead, pilot and fallback\r\nstrategies are underway primarily in Southeast Asia.\nCambodia is already considering including TACTs in its\r\nnational elimination policy and preparing for fast deployment if resistance\r\nworsens.\nBut most countries in Africa say it all depends on WHO\r\nendorsement and international funding.\nThe WHO still recommends the two-drug Artemisinin-based\r\ncombination therapy as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. It\r\nsays TACT may be considered in areas with high levels of drug resistance to ACT\r\nor in specific clinical situations where other treatment options are limited.",

    "content": "Kenya’s internet market is on the verge of a seismic shift. After years of heavy reliance on fibre optics, mobile broadband towers, and terrestrial infrastructure, a new player in town is poised to disrupt the game — satellite internet.\nAt the heart of this disruption is Starlink, launched by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and other satellite providers, whose ambitions now stretch far beyond rural connectivity.\nIn a recent online video clip circulating on the microblogging platform X — validated by Musk himself — the billionaire revealed a revolutionary next phase for Starlink: direct satellite-to-mobile phone communication.\n“There will be no dead zone anywhere in the world for your cell phone,” Musk declared. “Your phone will still work even if there are no cell towers.”\nThis declaration, made about Starlink’s growing partnership with American telecoms giant T-Mobile, hints at more than just improved rural access — it portends a direct challenge to traditional internet service providers (ISPs), mobile network operators (MNOs), and national infrastructure models.\nThe satellite-to-mobile service — which does not require traditional ground infrastructure like masts, fibre-optic cables, or cell towers — is a radical shift from how connectivity has traditionally been delivered.\nInstead of routing data through ground stations, Starlink satellites orbiting just 550 km above the Earth will be able to beam signals straight to smartphones equipped with compatible chips.\nThe implications are massive. Kenya, a country where MNOs like Safaricom, Airtel, and Telkom Kenya have spent billions laying fibre and building 4G and now 5G towers, now faces the possibility of being leapfrogged — not by local competitors, but by global satellite networks operating well outside national borders.\nAs of July 2025, Starlink services are already available across much of Kenya, mostly targeting rural and underserved areas.\nAccording to Dot Savvy founder, Moses Kemibaro, Starlink shook up the status quo in terms of offerings, which appeared to be a new, bright, and shiny internet service, it is quite expensive for most Kenyans, both for onboarding and sustenance.\n“The last time I checked, Starlink had around 19,000+ users, whereas most of its competitors on the ground have many more users and charge less in general.”\n“We also see that Starlink works best when in rural or underserved areas of Kenya, compared to the major towns and cities where high-quality internet is generally widely available. I get the sense that Starlink will be most successful in rural and peri-urban Kenya on this basis.”\nMonthly packages have dropped significantly since their launch, with basic consumer plans now starting at around Sh3,500, thanks to increased satellite deployment and regulatory clarity.\nAlready, Airlines are adopting the technology, with Qatar Airways last month introducing in-flight streaming on select aircraft, equipped with Starlink Wi-Fi, allowing passengers to stream global sporting action directly to their devices during flights.\n“As the first global airline to introduce Starlink’s high-speed connectivity combined with live sports streaming, we are proud to bring passengers closer to the sporting moments that matter most - wherever they are in the world, even if it is 35,000 feet,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Officer, Badr Mohammed Al-Meer.\nBut the satellite-to-mobile technology — expected to roll out fully in 2026 — introduces a new frontier: ubiquitous mobile connectivity without national operators.\nFrom an investor’s standpoint, this development is both thrilling and unsettling.\nTraditional ISPs and mobile companies in Kenya have been high on investors’ radars, particularly due to the growing demand for mobile data, fintech integration, and digital lifestyle services.\nSafaricom, the region’s most valuable telco, has long been the darling of the Nairobi Securities Exchange, commanding a 40 per cent market share in mobile data and dominating mobile money with M-PESA.\nHowever, satellite internet — and especially direct-to-device capability — challenges the economics of telco investment. Already, global venture capital has started flowing differently. African-focused digital infrastructure funds that once supported terrestrial cable and mobile tower expansions are now eyeing partnerships with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite firms — not just Starlink, but Amazon’s Project Kuiper and OneWeb, which are also eyeing the African market.\nMoreover, Kenya’s public and private investors are being forced to rethink long-term strategies.\nLocal telco firms' 5G rollout in the country, although promising for urban bandwidth, may face limited return on investments in sparsely populated areas.\nMeanwhile, smaller ISPs that depended on reselling fibre access or erecting local towers may find themselves priced out of relevance.\nPerhaps the most politically sensitive implication of satellite internet lies in the erosion of national control over communication infrastructure.\nThe Starlink-T-Mobile deal — where a US-based satellite company partners with a telecom entity 42 per cent owned by German stakeholders — effectively creates a cross-border communication system that bypasses Kenya’s Communications Authority, its cybersecurity laws, and, possibly, its tax regime.\nIn Kenya, internet providers must obtain licenses, submit to regulatory audits, and contribute to the Universal Service Fund.\nBut satellite signals beaming from space to devices may challenge this setup. How does one regulate a signal that doesn’t touch local towers? How do you enforce lawful interception or data protection rules?\nAlready, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) is in consultations with global regulators and African telecom alliances on how to manage this shift.\nA proposed regional policy framework is being floated by the African Telecommunications Union, aimed at harmonizing licensing and compliance expectations for satellite operators.\nKenya’s internet penetration, at around 48 per cent by early 2025, still leaves millions in remote areas offline or poorly connected.\nTerrestrial providers have struggled to justify commercial investment in low-density regions.\nStarlink’s model — now with the promise of direct-to-phone — could finally bridge this long-standing digital divide.\nIn the arid zones of Isiolo, Marsabit, and West Pokot, community health workers and teachers who once relied on patchy 2G signals may soon have real-time video, GPS, and cloud access.\nDisaster relief and climate monitoring services could operate with seamless connectivity even during floods or wildfires, when local towers often go down.\nIn urban areas, redundancy and faster speeds are also attractive. Nairobi tech hubs are exploring satellite failovers to protect against fibre cable cuts or cyberattacks on terrestrial infrastructure.\nSome fintech firms have begun pilot testing Starlink nodes as part of their business continuity plans.\nDespite a massive global outage that hit the ‘Elon Musk baby’ on Thursday, 24, the global tech giants hold that the 2025–2026 period is expected to be pivotal.\nStarlink has hinted at a major firmware update that will enable compatible smartphones to link directly with LEO satellites, initially in texting mode, later followed by voice and limited data.",

This\r\naligns with Kenya’s long-term energy transition strategy to reduce reliance on expensive thermal\r\nimports and enhance renewable generation.\n“While the total energy demand for the day stood at 42,943.11MWh, including thermal sources,\r\nwind, and interconnectors with Uganda and Ethiopia supplemented generation, we are glad to\r\nnote that it was KenGen’s steady delivery from indigenous resources that ensured grid stability,” Njenga said.\nThe milestone demand came without any reported load shedding, affirming the robust response\r\nby system operators. However, transmission lines such as Muhoroni-Chemosit and Kisumu-Muhoroni exceeded 120 per cent capacity, highlighting the need for urgent infrastructure\r\nreinforcement to keep pace with surging demand.",

    "content": "Control in your hands: How fast withdrawals redefine trader autonomyWhat does autonomy\r\nreally mean for a trader? In a world of fluctuating markets, it must be more\r\nthan simply choosing an asset and a direction. True autonomy is the capacity to\r\nact decisively on market opportunities, manage risk effectively, and access one's\r\ncapital without restriction. It’s a holistic sense of empowerment that many\r\nseek, but few find.\nThis complete\r\ncontrol rests on three fundamental pillars: unrestricted access to your\r\ncapital, unwavering confidence in your risk parameters, and the flawless\r\nexecution of your strategy. Recognizing this, Exness has engineered its entire\r\nplatform not just to facilitate trades, but to deliver this trifecta of\r\ncontrol, placing true autonomy directly into the hands of traders.\nThe foundation: Unrestricted control of your capital\nThe most potent\r\nsymbol of control is the ability to access your own money, whenever you want,\r\nwithout friction or delay. In an industry where withdrawal processes are often\r\nslow, opaque, and a source of anxiety, Exness has established a new benchmark.\r\nThe broker’s philosophy is simple: your funds are yours,  and accessing them\r\nshould be effortless.\nTo make this a\r\nreality,Exnesshas built an automated payments infrastructure, powered by a sophisticated\r\nproprietary system that streamlines everything from client verification to\r\npayment processing. The result of this technology is clear: an industry-leading 98% of\r\nwithdrawal requests are processed automatically¹. This level of automation\r\nmeans traders can access their funds 24/7, solidifying Exness’ position as the\r\nprovider of the fastest withdrawals in the market¹.\nThis is exemplified by\r\none unique, trader-centric feature: The broker guarantees that traders are\r\ncovered by Negative Balance Protection. This fundamental safety net ensures\r\ntraders will never owe more than their balance, adding an extra layer of peace\r\nof mind even in extreme market movements.\nThe final piece: Flawless control over your strategy\nWith your capital\r\nliquid and your positions secure, the final pillar of autonomy is ensuring your\r\nstrategic decisions translate perfectly into market outcomes. A brilliant\r\nstrategy is meaningless if it is undermined by high costs or poor execution.\nExness tackles this\r\nhead-on with a proprietary pricing engine and advanced execution algorithms.\r\nThis infrastructure is engineered to absorb market shocks and deliver stability\r\nwhen it matters most, givingtraderscritical control over their entry and exit points. Clients benefit from the\r\ntightest and most stable spreads in the market on key instruments like XAUUSD,\r\nBTCUSD, and USOIL,4which directly lowers trading costs and keeps\r\nstrategies intact during volatility.\nThis stability is\r\npaired with performance. Exness provides the most precise execution in the\r\nmarket⁵, which aims to fill orders at the best available price with minimal\r\ndelay. This level of precision means that a strategy works as designed, giving\r\ntraders ultimate control over their performance and P&L.\nExnesshas\r\ndemonstrated that true trader autonomy isn't about a single feature, but a\r\nfully integrated ecosystem designed for empowerment. The journey begins with\r\nthe philosophy of full control, proven by the market's fastest withdrawals, but\r\nit extends into every facet of the trading experience.\nFrom the financial\r\ncontrol of your capital, to the psychological control over risk, and finally to\r\nthe strategic control over your execution, Exness has systematically removed\r\nbarriers and placed power where it belongs: in your hands.\n1. At Exness, over 98% of withdrawals are processed\r\nautomatically. Processing times may vary depending on the chosen payment\r\nmethod. \"Fastest withdrawals\" refers to a comparison of Exness’\r\nwithdrawal processing time vs. 3 other brokers, last updated on 07.05.2025.\r\nProcessing times may vary depending on the chosen payment method.\n2. Exness allows positions to remain open until stop out at 0%\r\nmargin level. Once 0% margin level is reached, the position is closed\r\nregardless of whether the trader has decided to close it.\n3. On average, Exness has 3 times fewer stop outs than\r\ncompetitors. Analysis covers orders for April 2025, comparing Exness’s 0%\r\nstop-out level to 3 competitors’ levels (15%, 20%, 50%). To normalize extreme\r\nratios, stop-out results have been square-root transformed, values rounded to\r\nthe nearest whole number, without taking into account the conditions that indirectly\r\naffect the stop out.\n4. Tightest and most stable spread claims refer to the lowest\r\nmaximum spreads and the tightest average spreads on the Exness Pro account, for\r\nXAUUSD, USOIL, and BTCUSD, based on data collected from 25 August to 7\r\nSeptember 2024, when compared to the corresponding spreads across\r\ncommission-free accounts of other brokers.\n5.

    "content": "BODA BODA operators\r\nhave rejected new regulationswarning that if passed, it will push millions of families deeper into poverty and bring chaos int their operations.\nThey described theproposed Public Transport ,(Motorcycle Regulation) Bill (Senate Bill No. 38 of 2023) as \"retrogressive, punitive and disconnected from the realities of daily survival for thousands of young men and women who earn their living one trip at a time\".\nAppearing\r\nbefore the Parliamentary Departmental Committee on Transport and\r\nInfrastructure, the Boda Boda Safety Association of Kenya (BAK) flatly rejected  the\r\nBill sponsored by Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale.\n“This Bill\r\ndoes not bring safety, it brings suffering. It does not protect livelihoods, it\r\nthreatens to wipe them out,” said BAK president Kevin Mubadi, calling the\r\nproposed law a deliberate attempt to criminalise and commodify poverty.\nAt the heart\r\nof the association’s objections are the mounting costs and complicated\r\nbureaucracy that the Bill seeks to impose on riders who are already living hand\r\nto mouth, amid loans especially in asset financing.\nAmong its\r\nmost damaging provisions, BAK said, is the creation of 47 county-level Motorcycle\r\nTransport and Safety Boards, despite the existence of a national body—the National\r\nTransport and Safety Authority (NTSA)—already tasked with overseeing road\r\nsafety and rider registration.\nRiders would\r\nbe forced to register afresh at county level, duplicating what already exists\r\non the NTSA digital platform, the association has argued. According to BAK, this move is not just\r\nwasteful—it opens the floodgates for harassment, extortion and chaos.\n“Why are we\r\nbeing asked to register again, to pay again, to verify again? This is not\r\nregulation. This is punishment. It is taking the little we earn and giving it to\r\nbureaucrats and cartels,” said Mubadi.\nThe Bill\r\nalso proposes that every rider must be part of a SACCO, a move BAK says strips\r\nriders of their freedom of association and could easily lock out the poorest\r\nfrom operating.\n“We are not\r\nagainst organisation but it must be voluntary not forced. This is how cartels\r\nbegin. This is how dreams are killed,” said Mubadi.\nPerhaps most\r\npainfully, the Bill demands that motorcycles be fitted with GPS tracking\r\ndevices, that sellers supply helmets and jackets of specific colours, and that\r\nformal employment contracts be drawn between riders and motorcycle owners.\nThese\r\nrequirements, BAK argues, will drive up costs, benefit politically connected\r\nsuppliers,and further entrench corruption, all while forcing riders to choose\r\nbetween breaking the law or going hungry.\n“We are\r\nbarely surviving as it is. Now you want to make us pay for trackers, for\r\ncoloured jackets, for registration twice over, for approvals we don’t need?\r\nThis is not regulation, it is exploitation wearing the mask of policy,” said\r\nMubadi.\nWorse still,\r\nthe Bill proposes that boda bodas should not carry loads exceeding 50 kilogrammes, a move\r\nthat threatens to cut off remote communities from markets, deliveries and\r\nessential transport.\n“A sack of\r\nmaize weighs more than 90kg. This law would criminalize the transport of food.\r\nIt would harm farmers, kill small businesses and starve rural Kenya,” BAK\r\nwarned.\nFormal\r\nemployment contracts, another clause in the Bill, are equally unworkable according to the association which says the vast majority of riders operate on informal agreements that allow flexibility\r\nin an uncertain economy.\nForcing them into rigid contracts, BAK warns, would\r\ndestroy the very structure that allows many of them to work in the first place.\nBAK also\r\nrejected proposals to devolve regulation of motorcycle transport exclusively to\r\ncounties, saying this would contradict the NTSA Act and lead to confusion,\r\nduplication and inconsistent enforcement across the country.\nCalling for\r\na complete overhaul of the proposed law, BAK urged Parliament to halt the\r\nprocess and initiate a stakeholder-led conversation to improve the Traffic and\r\nNTSA Acts—without penalising the people who keep Kenya moving.\nBAK is the national umbrella body for Boda\r\nboda riders registered under the Societies Act of Kenya and represents over 1.2 million riders, with the sector being among the biggest employers in the country mainly for the youth.",

    "content": "CBK governor Kamau Thugge\nThe Central Bank of\r\nKenya is effectively powerless oncracking downon the unlawful\r\nbank accounts operated by county governments outside its control.\nThis is after it emerged\r\nthat there is no law or legal provisions granting it direct oversight of the\r\naccounts opened by the devolved units.\nIn revelations by\r\nthe CBK governor Kamau Thugge, to the Senate Standing Committee on Devolution\r\nand Intergovernmental Relations, unless accounts have been flagged the regulator\r\nsaid their hands are tied.\nThis came to the\r\nfore after the committee vice chair and nominated senator Catherine Mumma sought\r\nto knowwhat role the regulator plays in\r\nstreamlining the issue of account opening and management in the counties.\nHowever, CBK was first to exempt itself\r\nfrom the blame pointing to regulatory loopholes that the counties are\r\nexploiting.\n“Just to identify some of the challenges\r\nthat we face, one is the enforcement limitation that there is a lack of a\r\ndirect mandate by CBK to compel county governments to close unauthorised\r\naccounts,” said Thugge.\nAccording to the\r\n2015 County Government Public Finance Management (PFM) regulations, all county\r\nexchequer and government accounts must be maintained at the CBK — except for\r\npetty cash (imprest) accounts.\nBut counties have\r\nexploited ambiguities in the overarching PFM Act to justify widespread banking\r\nin commercial institutions.\nA report by the Controller\r\nof Budget Margaret Nyakango, released last month, shows that county governments\r\nmore than doubled the number of accounts they operate in commercial banks in\r\nthe past 12 months to March 2025.\nThe devolved units\r\nadded 1,763 new openings to hit 3431 accounts at commercial banks.\nThugge, said the\r\nPFM Act, gives county treasuries the discretion to open accounts, without\r\nspecifying the bank.\n“They are using\r\nthat legal gap to open accounts wherever they wish. The regulations say one\r\nthing, but the law is not explicit on enforcement or limitations,” the governor\r\ntold the senator Mohamed Abass chaired committee.\nHe further added that\r\nlegal ambiguities within the PFM Act and its regulations have created\r\nconflicting interpretations, allowing counties to bypass requirements that most\r\naccounts be held at the CBK.\nOperational\r\nconstraints also hamper oversight, with the CBK’s limited branch network making\r\nit difficult for counties in remote areas to access its services.\nIn addition, Thugge\r\npointed to weak coordination among key oversight bodies—including the Office of\r\nthe Auditor General and the Controller of Budget—which has led to gaps in\r\naccount visibility and reporting.\nThe regulator also\r\npointed out legacy arrangements, where some counties continue to use commercial\r\nbanks due to pre-devolution practices or for operational convenience, further\r\ncomplicating CBK’s efforts to centralize financial oversight.\nThuggesuggested\r\nthat while counties are required to copy the Controller of Budget when opening\r\naccounts, compliance is inconsistent.\n“If properly enforced, the Controller of\r\nBudget would know every time a county opens an account. That could be a useful\r\nenforcement entry point,” he said.\nKiambu Senator Karungo\r\nThangwa criticised CBK for not using its authority over commercial banks to\r\ndemand regular disclosures on county accounts.\n“You regulate all\r\nthese commercial banks. Why not issue a circular requiring them to notify CBK\r\nevery time a county account is opened?” asked Thangwa. “The way banks require\r\ndocumentation for large deposits, they should do the same for county accounts —\r\nand report quarterly.”\nAlongside law\r\nchanges to grant it direct oversight of the accounts, CBK is also now recommending\r\nthe establishment of a coordinated oversight framework involving the National\r\nTreasury, Auditor General, and Controller of Budget to enforce compliance.\nIt is also called\r\nfor urgent legislative amendments to align the PFM Act with existing\r\nregulations.\nCBK is pushing for\r\nthe fast-tracking of a national Treasury Single Account system, with the goal\r\nof rolling out a county-level TSA by the 2026–2027 financial year.\n“The idea is to\r\nconsolidate all county funds at CBK, with special provisions for donor or petty\r\ncash accounts to be maintained elsewhere under strict oversight,” said Thugge.",

    "content": "HF Group PLC has posted a remarkable 112 per cent year-on-year increase in its pre-tax profit for the first quarter of 2025, signalling the success of its ongoing transformation and diversification strategy.\nThe Group’s Profit Before Tax (PBT) rose to Sh337 million, up from Sh159 million in Q1 2024.\nThe sharp rise in earnings was underpinned by a 33 per cent  growth in total income, which climbed to Sh1.41 billion from Sh1.06 billion in the previous year.\nNet interest income saw a robust 46 per cent increase, while non-funded income contributed 30 per cent of total revenues, fueled by higher earnings from fees and commissions, custodial services, and income generated by the Group’s property and insurance subsidiaries.\n“We continue to realise the impact of our transformation journey. Our business model has evolved significantly, enabling us to deliver sustainable growth and value to our shareholders,” said HF Group CEO Robert Kibaara while releasing the results.\nMr. Kibaara also highlighted the successful completion of a rights issue earlier this year, which was oversubscribed by 38 per cent.\nThis exercise significantly boosted the Group’s capital position and reinforced investor confidence.\n“The successful rights issue... has enhanced our capital position, allowing us to power growth as we innovate to meet customer needs,” he stated.\nThe strong financial performance was also reflected in the Group’s key balance sheet metrics.\nDeposits increased by 16 per cent to Sh51.0 billion, indicating growing trust and market traction. The Group’s total assets rose by 18 per cent, reaching Sh73.4 billion.\nLiquidity levels remained robust at 45.1 per cent, well above the regulatory minimum of 20 per cent, providing a strong buffer for operations and future expansion.\nAdditionally, the Group’s core capital to risk-weighted assets stood at 21.3%, more than double the required 10.5 per cent, reflecting strong capitalisation and the capacity to support further business growth.\nOperating expenses rose by 19.1 per cent to Sh1.08 billion.\nThis increase was largely attributed to deliberate investments in talent acquisition and enhancements to digital infrastructure—moves aimed at supporting the Group’s growth agenda and strengthening service delivery.\nAt the same time, provisions for expected credit losses declined by 8.0 per cent. This reduction is seen as a result of better management of non-performing loans and an improved collections framework, pointing to enhanced asset quality and credit discipline.\nThe Group’s performance comes just months after it was added to the MSCI Frontier Markets Small Cap Index in February 2025.\nThis inclusion marks an important milestone and is expected to boost visibility among global investors tracking emerging and frontier markets.\nHF Group, which began as a mortgage financier, has since evolved into an integrated financial services provider with operations across personal, business, and institutional banking. It also has interests in property, insurance, trade finance, and diaspora banking.\nThe company underwent a major restructuring and rebranding in 2015, transforming from Housing Finance into HF Group—a non-operating holding company with four subsidiaries: HFC, HFDI, HF Bancassurance Intermediary (HFBI), and HF Foundation.\nToday, the Group continues to deepen its footprint through strategic investments and a focus on long-term value creation.\n“This performance underscores the resilience of our business and the opportunities that lie ahead as we build a more diversified and digitally empowered financial institution,” said Mr. Kibaara.\nAs the financial sector continues to navigate a rapidly evolving economic landscape, HF Group’s strong Q1 results place it in a favourable position to capitalise on emerging opportunities and contribute meaningfully to Kenya’s broader economic goals",

    "summary": "The current system works perfectly for the banks.\nThey would rather you keep taking overdrafts at 18 per cent. Because that is where the margins live.",
    "content": "Let’s talk about leverage.\nI have seen this play out many times, and it used to puzzle me: how does gearing actually work? Everyone talks about it like it is some secret sauce, but very few explain it in plain language.\nIn theory, it sounds like a cheat code: borrow money, invest it, earn more than what you are paying in interest, and retire in peace.\nSimple, right? Guess again, most people use leverage the same way we use alcohol, as if our livers are made of stainless steel. Leverage can devour you from the inside if not managed well. I have seen this and it is not pretty.\nSo here is how gearing actually works: You start with your money, the banks call it “your equity”. Let’s say you have $10,000.\nYou invest that in an income-generating fund or asset. Now, to gear the investment, the bank or investment firm offers to top you up with additional capital, using your investment as collateral.\nYou can go in at 1:1, 2:1, even 3:1 or if you are feeling very brave or like me you do not listen to your more conservative wife, you take 4:1. So your $10,000 now is $40,000 deployed in the market.\nIf you pick an income fund yielding 6–7 per cent and your borrowing cost is two to three per cent, you are making a solid positive spread. You are using someone else’s money to grow your returns without touching your original capital.\nSounds beautiful. But here is the catch: you carry the risk. If the value of your investment drops, you could face a margin call, which is just a fancy way of saying, “Put in more money or we sell your stuff.” And trust me, they never sell it at the top, they sell at the point when the bank feels their money is at risk.\nSo yes, gearing can multiply your returns, but it can also magnify your losses.\nSMEs in Kenya: Paying for capital with blood\nIn Kenya, SMEs are the beating heart of the economy. Everyone says it. Every politician swears by it. But let us talk about what it costs to keep that heart beating.\nMost SMEs are surviving—barely—on overdrafts and short-term loans with interest rates that would make your chama treasurer faint.\nBorrow Sh500,000 at 18 per cent (and that’s a generous rate), and you are parting with Sh90,000 a year just in interest. If you bring in Fuliza, which most hustlers will be accessing, the interest rate jumps five or sixfold.\nAnd don’t forget the arrangement fees, maintenance fees, penalty fees, basically, fees for breathing. Meanwhile, across the globe (enter the UAE), people are playing a very different game. They are using their investments to access liquidity and cheaply.\nIt works like this: you build a capital base, say a mutual fund or an income-generating portfolio. Then, instead of selling it, you use it as collateral to access an overdraft or credit facility at a much lower rate.\nLet’s do the math: you are earning six to seven per cent from your investment and borrowing against it at 4.5 per cent.\nThe money keeps working, you get the cash you need, and you avoid paying 18 per cent just for staying alive. That is leverage done right. That is how the smart money moves.\nBut let me ask the question I kept raising (often in vain) in our internal meetings at the bank: “Why aren’t we offering this to more clients?” You want the truth? Because the current system works perfectly for the banks.\nThey would rather you keep taking overdrafts at 18 per cent. Because that is where the margins live. It is not a bug. It is a feature. The longer you stay stuck, the better their quarterly results look.\nIt is the same twisted logic that explains why banks would rather keep you revolving on your credit card at 38–40 per cent than help you convert that debt into a personal loan at 13–14 per cent. I have seen it firsthand—conversion requests turned down flat.\nWhy? Because the client had not claimed “debt distress”. Yes, you heard that right. To get access to a more humane rate, you basically had to wave a little white flag and admit you were drowning.\nBut you do not want to do that, no one wants to sign off on a document that reads like a polite way of declaring bankruptcy. It is humiliating. It labels you. And once it is on file, it does not go away quietly.\nSo what do most people do? They keep swiping, keep paying the minimum, and stay stuck in the hamster wheel, racking up interest that makes your credit card balance feel like it’s growing by itself. (Spoiler alert: it is.)\nMeanwhile, the bank? Smiling. Because this is the model. The longer you suffer, the better it performs. But I was persistent with my questioning: Why aren’t we guiding clients better? Why aren’t we converting more of these balances into structured loans that actually give people a way out? You would think I was asking to shut down the entire credit card division.\nThe room would go silent. Eyes would roll. Sales would shrug. And I would go back to my desk wondering why I had not opened my own bank.\nIf you are reading this and paying attention, you do not need to wait for the system to change (it will not), but you can change how you use the system. Start building a capital base. Use it to access cheaper, smarter credit. The goal is to make debt work for you, not the other way around.\nThe writer is a Compliance, risk, and fintech executive",

    "content": "When most people hear “investment,” they think of charts, complex jargon and some overconfident guy on TikTok shouting about the latest coin “going to the moon”.\nBut here’s the part we do not hear enough: investing is not just about choosing an asset, it is about choosing one that fitsyou.\nSomeone once said, “Personal finance should be more personal than finance”. It’s like buying a suit. You do not grab the flashiest one just because everyone else is wearing it. You get one that fits your size, taste and budget.\nSame thing with investing. Your age, income, goals and even personality (yes, your tendency to panic when the market dips) should guide your decisions. But too often, we follow trends or peer pressure instead of asking: “Is this aligned with where I’m trying to go?”\nBecause the goal is not to follow the herd, it’s to build a strategy that fits you and your journey.\nNot every investment is your friend\nWould you wear a wool suit in Diani in December? Or Crocs to a boardroom? (My boy Anto might. But do not ask him, he’s…unique.) Same goes for investments.\nWhat works for your cousin in Toronto earning in CAD under Canadian tax rules might be a disaster for you in sunny, tax-free Dubai. It’s not about copying what’s hot. It’s about what fitsyou, your income, location, goals and risk tolerance.\nThat’s why we in compliance insist on two things: One is suitability: Is this investment right for your goals and timeframe? Planning to buy a home in two years? Do not lock your cash in a 10-year bond.\nTwo is appropriateness: Do you actually understand what you are buying? What are the risks? What happens if things go wrong?A 25-year-old might be fine with high-growth equities. But a retiree? Probably not. That’s like wearing flip-flops to a snowstorm.\nToo often, people get sold flashy products based on hype or commissions, 15-year offshore insurance plans that barely pay, or structured products that reset just when they were about to deliver returns. And who gets burned? The investor who did not ask the right questions.\nBut this is where a proper compliance framework comes in, to protect investors from being mismatched to products that do not serve them.\nThe fact sheet: Your investment label\nEvery regulated product (mutual funds, sukuks, REITs) comes with a fact sheet. No, it does not come with flashing lights or trending audio. But it’s the most important document between you and a bad decision.\nThink of it like a nutrition label. You would not (or should not) buy a snack without checking the sugar content. Same goes here. A fact sheet tells you the risk level (mild, medium, ghost pepper), historical returns (not gospel, but useful), fees (the sneaky ones that nibble at your profits) and liquidity (how fast you can get your cash if things go sideways).\nIf you are risk-averse, the fact sheet will show if the fund bounces around too much. If you need liquidity, it will tell you how long your money is locked in. But here’s the key:you have to read it. And if you do not get it,ask. Because the market does not refund ignorance. A few minutes of reading now could save you years of regret.\nHard lessons and honest questions\nI have seen retirees lose their life savings because a smooth-talking advisor sold them a high-risk note disguised as “secure”. I have watched fresh grads get locked into long-term investments with 30 per cent exit penalties, before they have even paid off Helb. That is not investing. That is gambling in a tuxedo and calling it strategy.\nHere’s the truth:your risk appetite is personal. You cannot borrow it from your cousin’s WhatsApp group or that guy on YouTube with a ring light. Before you invest, ask:Can I afford to lose this money?Do I need it back within one to two years?Will I sleep if the market drops 10 per cent?Am I investing for growth, income or just to outpace inflation?\nAnswer honestly (not aspirationally) and you will start to see what works foryou. Because a good investment, like a good suit, should not pinch when things get uncomfortable.\nThe final word: Suit up\nEach investment has its time, place and type of investor. The goal is not to do everything, it is to do what works foryou, consistently. You would not wear Maasai sandals in a snowstorm. So why invest like your friend in London when you live in Dubai, earn in AED and plan to retire in Nairobi?\nInvestment is personal.Suit up accordingly.",

    "content": "Subsidies serve several economic and policy objectives: correcting market failures where social benefits exceed private benefits, supporting strategic industries deemed vital for national security or development, redistributing income to vulnerable populations, and stabilising volatile markets such as agriculture.\nSubsidies serve several economic and policy objectives: correcting market failures where social benefits exceed private benefits, supporting strategic industries deemed vital for national security or development, redistributing income to vulnerable populations, and stabilising volatile markets such as agriculture.\nAccounting for roughly 21 per cent of Kenya’s GDP, agriculture is rightly seen as a strategic sector, and successive governments have backed it through subsidies, price supports, concessional credit schemes and other state-led interventions.\nThe economic rationale often focuses on addressing externalities, supporting infant industries, or ensuring food security and, more recently, building climate resilience.\nIn practice, subsidies take various forms such as direct cash payments, tax breaks, price supports, input subsidies (seeds, fertilisers), credit subsidies with below-market interest rates and infrastructure investments that benefit specific sectors.\nKenya currently operates several government subsidy programmes and market interventions aimed at supporting farmers.\nThese programmes are managed by different institutions and often overlap in purpose and function, contributing to a classic case of bureaucratic duplication and market distortions.\nThey include the fertiliser subsidy programmes. The government has implemented different fertiliser subsidypolicies since 2009, with the most recent being the one that came into effect in September 2022.\nIt is part of the National Fertiliser Subsidy Programme, which aims to make fertiliser more affordable and accessible, supporting food production and stabilising food prices.\nThe subsidised fertiliser is sold at a reduced price of Sh2,500 per 50kg bag, compared to the market price of Sh6,500. The estimated cost of this new subsidy was Sh45.5 billion, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs.\nAdditionally, the Commodities Fund provides loans to farmers at an interest rate of as low as three per cent. The fund supports farming operations, price stabilisation and other approved activities. It operates as a separate source of agricultural credit, alongside commercial banks.\nThe existence of COMFUND as a parallel agricultural banking system with three per cent subsidised interest rates particularly exemplifies the knowledge problem– a government agency attempting to perform credit allocation functions that market interest rates would handle more efficiently.\nThere is another programme for coffee farmers under the Coffee Cherry Advance Revolving Fund. This programme allows farmers to receive early payments for their coffee at Sh80 per kilogramme of cherry as a form of minimum guaranteed return.\nInstead of waiting for the full payment after selling their coffee, farmers receive an advance payment per kilogramme of cherry delivered to processing units. The fund has been allocated up to Sh6.7 billion in the current financial year.\nThis is alongside other infrastructure and processing subsidies that focus on improving coffee production and processing. They include rehabilitation of coffee factories, subsidies for equipment and support for transportation costs.\nBesides these interventions – free subsidy, low interest loans and advance payment – the government announced a waiver of Sh6.8 billion in debts owed by coffee societies in June 2024 and more recently by the CS in his budget speech.\nThis means the government will write off the debts and the societies will no longer be required to repay them. While these interventions are designed with noble intentions, supporting farmers and ensuring food security, this raises a clear trade-off.\nBeyond cost, market distortions are emerging. Artificially low input prices and guaranteed price floors risk fostering dependence among farmers. They may also deter private sector actors from investing in critical segments of the value chain.\nKenya’s coffee sector already struggles with marketing inefficiencies, and state-driven interventions may be entrenching, rather than resolving, these problems.\nFrom a public financial management perspective, Kenya cannot afford to maintain expensive subsidy programmes indefinitely.\nThe country's fiscal space is constrained and every billion shillings spent on subsidies represents foregone investments in education, healthcare, infrastructure or debt reduction.\nReforming subsidies could free up resources that could fund thousands of kilometres of rural roads, hundreds of health facilities or significant debt reduction. The opportunity cost of current subsidy spending is simply too high to ignore.\nThe path forward is not to eliminate agricultural support but to reform it. Kenya needs to shift from blanket subsidies to more strategic, time-bound interventions.\nFirst, instead of repeated price guarantees, the government could invest in systems that improve market functioning. Warehouse receipt systems, digital marketplaces and commodity exchanges would help farmers secure better prices without distorting incentives.\nSecond, resources should be redirected toward genuine public goods. These include agricultural research, extension services, rural roads and climate-resilient technologies. Such investments generate long-term productivity gains without creating market dependencies.\nFinally, all subsidy programmes should include sunset clauses. Each intervention must have clear performance metrics and defined exit strategies. This would create a framework for accountability and avoid permanent reliance on state support.\nThe sector already benefits from significant tax incentives, including VAT exemptions on key inputs and machinery. What is required now is a shift toward policies that promote private investment, improve productivity and build market resilience.\nThe case for reform is urgent. Delaying action risks deeper fiscal pressure and abrupt spending cuts down the line. Kenya has the tools to support its farmers more effectively. What it needs is the political will to deploy public resources where they will have the greatest, most sustainable impact.\nFarzana is an economist specialising in fiscal policy and development",

    "content": "Nairobi County clinical officers in a peaceful demonstration in Nairobi on April 30, 2025. They have the highest unemployment rate of any health cadre/DOUGLAS OKIDDY\nKenya’s Clinical Officers have won a major boost after the United Kingdom last week affirmed they can work there as Physician Associates (PAs).\nUK’s General Medical Council (GMC) had in January announced that Clinical Officers from Kenya and 14 other countries could register to practice as PAs, placing them alongside nurses and doctors, who have long sought better-paying jobs in Britain.\nHowever, the migration process was suspended until the end of an ongoing independent review of the roles of physician associates (PAs) in the UK.\nThere was concern that UK might scrap PA roles altogether, as demanded by some top doctors.\nThe report of the exercise, called the Gillian Leng Review, was published on July 16. It affirmed PAs were critical in UK heath system and only recommended they should work under doctor supervision and should be renamed to physician assistants.\nHealth Principal Secretary Mary Muthoni confirmed Kenya will now formally request the UK to include Clinical Officers in the labour agreements that already send hundreds of Kenyan nurses to work there.\n“We will continue working with line ministries and organisations to support the growth, mobility and global competitiveness of our health workforce,” she said.\n“The recent acknowledgement by the UK’s General Medical Council (GMC), which allows our Clinical Officers to register and practice in the United Kingdom, is a significant step forward. It affirms the quality of our training institutions and opens up meaningful opportunities for our professionals to thrive globally.”\nThe Global Association of Clinical Officers and Physician Associates (GACOPA), which is led by a Kenyan, has already met Labour PS Shadrack Mwadime to discuss the way forward. They met PS Muthoni on Wednesday.\nGacopa president Austin Oduor told The Star the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour confirmed they would seek an amendment to the UK-Kenya nurses MoU.\n“Today's meeting with the Principal Secretary for Public Health, Mary Muthoni, and our earlier engagement with PS Labour Shadrack Mwadime have laid a clear and progressive roadmap. The Government of Kenya has committed to initiate formal inclusion of Clinical Officers into the existing bilateral MOU between Kenya and the United Kingdom, which currently accommodates nurses,” he said.\n“This move reflects the country's recognition of Clinical Officers as a critical component of Kenya’s health workforce and their growing global demand.”\nAustin Oduor,  President of the Global Association of Clinical Officers and Physician Associates (GACOPA).\nThe Clinical Officer profession in Kenya dates back to the colonial era when\r\nthe country faced an acute shortage of doctors.\nThe colonial government began training mid-level health workers to perform\r\nbasic medical care where no doctors were available.\nKenya formalised the role in the 1960s. But unlike nursing, which is well\r\nestablished and recognised worldwide, Clinical Medicine remained little known\r\noutside a handful of countries, mainly in East and Southern Africa.\nClinical Officers have since become the backbone of Kenya’s rural health\r\nsystem, diagnosing, treating, performing minor surgeries, and running health\r\ncentres often without a doctor in sight.\nYet despite their vital role, they have faced open hostility from doctors\r\nand the health establishment.\nDirector General for Health Dr Patrick Amoth once called for the profession\r\nto be scrapped altogether, arguing it duplicated other medical roles.\n“The number of clinical officers has increased, but they suffer\r\nunemployment. Is it prudent to continue on that path or retrace and progress\r\ntheir careers? The best course of action is not to make a painful situation\r\nworse,” he said in April last year.\nKenya has approximately 30,000 registered COs, according to the Clinical\r\nOfficers Council. They have the highest unemployment rate of any health cadre.\r\nAmoth said close to 14,000 of them are jobless.\nThe clinicians fought back and even demanded the right to be called\r\n‘Clinical Doctors’.\nCOs in Kenya are mainly trained through two pathways: the Diploma in\r\nClinical Medicine (three years) and the Bachelor’s Degree in Clinical Medicine\r\n(four years), each followed by a one year internship. Degree holders can apply\r\nto study the five-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) to\r\nbecome doctors.\nThe UK’s door for COs was initially opened in January when the country’s\r\nNational Health Service (NHS) announced plans to triple the number of PAs to\r\nplug gaps left by chronic doctor shortages.\nThe General Medical Council (GMC) – similar to Kenya’s Kenya Medical\r\nPractitioners and Dentists Council (KMPDC) – said it would accept\r\nforeign-trained PAs from 15 countries — including Kenya, Ghana, Zimbabwe, and\r\nSouth Africa — if they pass English language tests, pay a £500 (Sh 87,500)\r\nregistration fee and complete further assessments.\nPS Muthoni said this recognition confirmed the high quality of Kenya’s\r\ntraining programmes.\n“Clinical Officers are central to delivering primary healthcare, especially\r\nin underserved areas, and are instrumental in achieving Universal Health\r\nCoverage. It is encouraging to see their dedication now recognised\r\ninternationally,” she said.\nHowever, the plan is being opposed in Britain. Some doctors warn that\r\ntraining standards in some countries (Kenya not included) are patchy.\nFor example, Ghana’s Medical and Dental Council recently de-accredited half\r\nof all PA training programmes over quality concerns.\nUK doctors have also raised safety fears after cases of PAs being mistaken\r\nfor doctors, leading to misdiagnoses. Some professional groups are now suing\r\nthe GMC over what they call a lack of proper oversight.",

    "content": "Whether re-boiled water actually affects the taste of your drinks will depend entirely on the specifics of your local water supply and your personal preferences.\nThe kettle is a household staple practically everywhere – how else would we make our hot drinks?\nBut is it okay to re-boil water that’s already in the kettle from last time? While bringing water to a boildisinfects it, you may have heard that boiling water more than oncewill somehow make the water harmfuland therefore you should empty the kettle each time.\nSuch claims are often accompanied by the argument that re-boiled water leads to the accumulation of allegedly hazardous substances including metals such as arsenic, or salts such as nitrates and fluoride.\nThis isn’t true. To understand why, let’s look at what is in our tap water and what really happens when we boil it.\nLet’s take the example of tap water supplied bySydney Water, Australia’slargest water utilitywhich supplies water to Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra region.\nFrom thepublicly available datafor the January to March 2025 quarter for the Illawarra region, these were the average water quality results:\nThe water contained trace amounts of metals such as iron and lead, low enough magnesium levels that it can’t be tasted, and sodium levels substantially lower than those in popularsoft drinks.\nThese and all other monitored quality parameters were well within theAustralian Drinking Water Guidelinesduring that period. If you were to make tea with this water, re-boiling would not cause a health problem. Here’s why.\nTo concentrate substances in the water, you’d need to evaporate some of the liquid while the chemicals stay behind. Water evaporates at any temperature, but the vast majority of evaporation happens at the boiling point – when water turns into steam.\nDuring boiling, somevolatile organic compoundsmight escape into the air, but the amount of the inorganic compounds (such as metals and salts) remains unchanged.\nWhile the concentration of inorganic compounds might increase as drinking water evaporates when boiled, evidence showsit doesn’t happento such an extent that it would be hazardous.\nLet’s say you boil one litre of tap water in a kettle in the morning, and your tap water has a fluoride content of 1mg per litre, which is within the limits of Australian guidelines.\nYou make a cup of tea taking 200ml of the boiled water. You then make another cup of tea in the afternoon by re-boiling the remaining water.\nOn both occasions, if heating was stopped soon after boiling started, the loss of water by evaporation would be small, and the fluoride content in each cup of tea would be similar.\nBut let’s assume that when making the second cup, you let the water keep boiling until 100ml of what’s in the kettle evaporates. Even then, the amount of fluoride you would consume with the second cup (0.23mg) would not be significantly higher than the fluoride you consumed with the first cup of tea (0.20mg).\nThe same applies to any other minerals or organics the supplied water may have contained. Let’s take lead: the water supplied in the Illawarra region as mentioned above, had a lead concentration of less than 0.0001mg per litre. To reach an unsafe lead concentration (0.01mg per litre, according to Australian guidelines) in a cup of water, you’d need to boil down roughly 20 litres of tap water to just that cup of 200ml.\nPractically that is unlikely to happen – most electric kettles are designed to boil briefly before automatically shutting off. As long as the water you’re using is within the guidelines for drinking water, you can’t really concentrate it to harmful levels within your kettle.\nWhether re-boiled water actually affects the taste of your drinks will depend entirely on the specifics of your local water supply and your personal preferences.\nThe slight change in mineral concentration, or the loss of dissolved oxygen from water during boiling may affect the taste for some people – although there are a lot of other factors thatcontribute to the taste of your tap water.\nThe bottom line is that as long as the water in your kettle was originally compliant with guidelines for safe drinking water, it will remain safe and potable even after repeated boiling.\nFaisal Haiis Professor and Head of School of Civil, Mining, Environmental and Architectural Engineering,University of Wollongong\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

In\r\n2024, Kenya reported five further cVDPV2 cases, and some were paralysed.Routine\r\nimmunisation in Kenya achieves roughly 91 per cent polio vaccine coverage, but\r\nrates dip as low as about 77 per cent in northeastern regions, often near\r\nrefugee camps and areas of low sanitation, according to the Ministry of Health.",
    "content": "For decades, the poliovirus has\r\nnot just crippled bodies—it has left indelible marks on hearts, daily routines,\r\ndreams and entire communities.\nAnne Wafula Strike, a 56-year-old Kenyan-born British, is a polio\r\nsurvivor, a paralympian\r\nand a disability rights and inclusion advocate.\nShehas been compelled to\r\nstart an initiative geared towards creating awareness on the importance of polio\r\nimmunisation as she empowers other polio survivors through sports.\nAnne says she started the advocacy in 2000, but it gained momentum in 2006 when she moved to the UK, which gave her a bigger platform to champion the rights of people living with\r\ndisability.\nShe was motivated to start the programme by the challenges she experienced as a polio survivor while living in Kenya, where people with disability report being ostracised.\n\"As a polio survivor myself, I saw the challenges faced\r\nby people living with physical disabilities, especially those caused by\r\npolio,\" she explained. \"Sports gave me not just physical strength but\r\nalso confidence, social inclusion and mental stability. I wanted to share that\r\ntransformative power with others like me, to show them that polio is not the\r\nend of their potential,” she added.\nJoyce Ambasa, a 42-year-old polio survivor and mother, has\r\nbeen a beneficiary of Anne’s initiative, and intends to use the sport to\r\nalso spread vaccination awareness. She is a member and player\r\nin the Kenya wheelchair basketball federation.\nShe talks about her journey, having\r\nbeen infected with polio when she was two years old.\nJoyce Ambasa, a player and a member of the Kenya Wheelchair Basketball Federation.\n“I got polio when I was two years old and it has been tough\r\nfor me living among people with functional limbs. My school life was difficult\r\nas I had to be carried by my father to and from school every day.”\nShe says that joining the Kenya Wheelchair Basketball team\r\nhas been of immense help to her. She narrates the painful ordeal of getting employment in Kenya as a person with disability.\nShe says: “Getting a job in Kenya\r\nas a person with disability is quite difficult. This federation gives me a\r\nchance for employment since I can play for the team and earn an\r\nallowance that helps me to pay my bills.”\nAccording to Anne, participating in sports has been\r\nlife-changing on multiple fronts. Mentally, Anne says it cultivated a sense of\r\nindependence and breaking limitations. Physically, it strengthened her body\r\nagainst the aftereffects of polio, improving mobility and stamina.\nSocially,\r\nsports opened doors to community acceptance and meaningful friendships that often elude persons with disabilities. \"It’s not just about winning medals,\" Anne\r\nshared, \"it’s about changing mindsets and breaking barriers that society\r\nimposes on us.\"\nThe multiple benefits as shared by Anne are confirmed by Joyce.\r\nShe confirms that indeed participating in sports as a person with disability has\r\nmany advantages. She says: “Other than the allowances I get, playing has really\r\nhelped me to be active, which has given me Stamina to ride the wheelchair as I move\r\naround and also to stay healthy because running around keeps my body active.”\nAfred Simiyu Barasa, a 54-year-old polio survivor and\r\npresident of the Kenya\r\nWheelchair Basketball Federation, narrates his ordeal as a polio survivor. Just\r\nlike Joyce, he also contracted polio at two years, as he was told by his\r\nparents.\nUnlike\r\nJoyce, he received his polio vaccine when he was already infected with the\r\nvirus; hence, it did not have any effect.\nHe notes that polio is a stigmatising disease as\r\nit makes survivors who are paralysed view themselves as less human.\n“Many\r\npeople, including family members, treat people affected with polio differently. Most\r\npeople, especially in the rural areas, have left people with disabilities to act\r\nas home guards. They are not allowed to go anywhere because the families want\r\nto preserve their status in society.”\nAlfred says\r\nthat wheelchair basketball is like a rehabilitation activity. It helps turn\r\npeople who would otherwise suffer from stigma and boring lifestyle into vibrant\r\nand energetic humans who can fend for themselves.\n“Starting\r\nthis sporting activity in the late 90s, we did not fathom the incredible impact\r\nit was going to have on the participants. Joining hands together with\r\npassionate people like Anne Wafula in supporting disabled people to regain\r\ntheir full potential in life and also create awareness to prevent further polio\r\ninfections is in itself reassuring,” says Alfred.\nAnne recounts one memorable moment that reinforced her\r\ndedication to this cause. She witnessed the joy and determination of\r\nyoung polio survivors engaging in sports activities organised through her\r\ninitiatives.\n\"Seeing a child who once thought their disability meant\r\na limited future now running, laughing, and dreaming big is a priceless moment.\r\nThey reaffirm that what we are doing matters and it truly changes lives,\"\r\nshe said.\nShe is equally passionate about her advocacy for\r\nimmunisation, stressing a clear message for parents and policymakers.\r\n\"Polio is a disease we can prevent entirely with vaccines. I urge parents\r\nto immunise their children fully and consistently. For policymakers, the\r\nmessage is clear: we must prioritise funding, education and infrastructure to\r\nreach every vulnerable child. Complacency is the enemy because we are almost\r\nthere—close to eradicating polio—but we must push harder to cross the finish\r\nline,” she notes.\nAnne believes in a collective\r\nand multifaceted approach from everyone to eliminate polio. She says, \"Kenya and the world\r\nneed to improve surveillance, enhance community engagement to combat\r\nmisinformation and ensure vaccines reach even the remotest areas. We cannot\r\nafford to backslide. Protecting vulnerable populations means looking at health,\r\neducation and social support systems collectively and efficiently.”\nShe calls on the government and parents to fast-track the\r\nuptake of polio vaccines. She says the government must ensure that\r\nthe vaccines are available, while parents should avail their children for vaccination.\nAlfred calls on the government to fund such\r\nsporting activities to reach as many polio patients in the country as\r\npossible, to also help them realise their dream. He says this sport will make\r\nthem active and give them stamina to take care of themselves.\nLooking ahead, Anne shares a hopeful vision for Kenya’s\r\nchildren, especially those facing polio-related challenges. \"I envision a\r\nKenya where every child with a disability has access to not only health\r\nservices but also opportunities to thrive through education, sports and\r\ncommunity support. I want young kids to see role models like me and know their\r\ncondition does not define their destiny. This vision requires collective\r\neffort, but it’s achievable.”\nKenya\r\nhas not reported any cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) since 2013, when the last\r\noutbreak occurred. That outbreak was imported from Somalia and affected the\r\nDadaab refugee camp in Garissa County. The country is officially classified as\r\nwild poliovirus-free, consistent with the WHO Africa Region's certification of\r\nWPV eradication in August 2020.\nHowever,\r\nthe main threat now comes from vaccine-derived polioviruses (especially\r\ncVDPV2), which continue to circulate in some parts of Kenya due to gaps in\r\nimmunisation coverage. These mutated viruses can emerge in under-immunised\r\ncommunities when the weakened virus used in oral polio vaccines mutates and\r\nregains virulence.\nIn\r\n2024, Kenya reported five further cVDPV2 cases, primarily among children in the\r\nKakuma Refugee Camp, and an environmental positive sample in Nairobi’s\r\nKamukunji area.\nRoutine\r\nimmunisation in Kenya achieves roughly 91 per cent polio vaccine coverage, but\r\nrates dip as low as about 77 per cent in northeastern regions, often near\r\nrefugee camps and areas of low sanitation, according to the Ministry of Health.",

    "content": "IVF Illustration/ Gemini\nMany women in Kenya are turning to in vitrofertilisation(IVF) as a solution to infertility, but their chances of success are often diminished by one critical factor: age.\nAlthough fertility clinics in the country report reasonable success rates for younger women, a large number of patients only seek treatment after age 35, when the quality of eggs has already declined and IVF becomes less effective, fertility expert Dr Kireki Omanwa told the Star.\n“The success rate varies and depends on many things. It depends on the age of the patient, especially the lady. The success rate starts dropping after 35 years,” he said.\nAfter 35, the biological environment becomes less receptive, making it harder for pregnancies to take hold and progress successfully.\nThe likelihood of success starts to fall significantly and by age 40, drops sharply. Yet in Kenya, cultural stigma, lack of awareness and delays in seeking help mean that many women do not begin IVF until their late 30s or 40s, when their chances are already low.\nThe trend is similar globally. IVF success rates for women under 35 can exceed 50 per cent, but for those over 40, they often fall below 15 per cent, even in the most advanced clinics.\nIn Kenya, experts estimate IVF success at around 60–65 per cent for younger women using their own eggs, but just 30–33 per cent for those over 35 and about 10–20 per cent for women above 40.\nOmanwa–a fertility specialist at Frontline Medical Consultants on Ngong Avenue–explains that age-related decline in fertility is only one piece of a larger picture.\n“But it’s not just about age. The quality of the sperm also matters. If it is poor quality, we have poor quality embryos and these will either not implant or, if they do implant, they may end up having a miscarriage.”\nHe adds that physical conditions affecting the womb can also interfere with IVF success.\n“There can be issues with the womb, the lining, or the cavity for that matter. If there are things growing there, for example fibroids, of course this will inhibit the implantation and the full development of the baby, so it will affect the outcome.”\nThe immune system also plays a crucial role in whether a pregnancy is sustained.\n“The immune system is very important because it protects our bodies from any foreign material. For women, a pregnancy is actually a foreign body, so the immune system has to accept that there is a foreigner who is going to live inside here for nine to ten months and then we are going to co-exist. If the immune system says no, then the IVF process won’t be successful.”\nOther factors include hormonal imbalances, underlying health conditions like diabetes and hypertension and autoimmune diseases.\n“If the hormone levels are not where they’re supposed to be, we will have implantation failure or loss of the pregnancy,” he said.\n“Systemic diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes can affect the outcome. That excess sugar circulating in the system is actually toxic to the baby when the baby is growing in the womb. Autoimmune diseases can make the environment very unforgiving for the embryo. All these things have to be taken into consideration when we are talking about success rates.”\nHowever, Omamwa, who is also president of the Kenya Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society, says on average, IVF success rate is around 40 per cent, which matches outcomes in many developed countries.\nTrained in Poland and having worked in London on Harley Street before returning home, Omanwa addressed concerns about the expertise available in Kenya. Many of his colleagues also trained and worked abroad and brought that experience with them.\n“What is done in other countries–whether it is in the UK, Germany, America, India, or South Africa–we actually do it here in Kenya. The expertise we have is up to par and our success rates are also up to par. The only thing that we don’t do is cryopreservation or freezing of ovaries for women who have cancer. Otherwise, everything else, we do.”\nAt his clinic, demand for fertility services continues to rise. He sees patients two afternoons a week and consults with around 15 patients per day.\n“So in a year, I possibly see more than 1,000.”",

    "summary": "",
    "content": "Some people are trading chemical sunscreens in favour of mineral versions because of fears over toxicity, pollution and effectiveness. Is there actually any difference?\nMineral sunscreen is having a moment. Amid concerns that so-called \"chemical\" sunscreens may be bad for our bodies, brains, and even coral reefs, mineral-based formulations have become the fastest-growing share of the global sunscreen market.\nBut debates over \"chemical\" versus \"mineral\" sunscreens are riddled with misconceptions. Many commonly repeated claims – such as mineral sunscreens not containing chemicals; that chemical sunscreens have been proven harmful; or that chemical sunscreens absorb UV, while mineral ones only reflect it – are misleading, even false.\nThe confusion begins with terminology. \"Everything is a chemical,\" points out Brian Diffey, emeritus professor of photobiology in dermatological sciences at the UK's University of Newcastle and inventor of sunscreen's UVA star rating. What people call \"chemical\" filters are more accurately termed organic, since they contain carbon-hydrogen bonds, says Diffey. Inorganic filters (often called mineral), primarily titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, lack those bonds. All are chemicals.\nSeeking to protect our skin and bodies from the Sun is not a new trend – nor are sunscreens, organic or inorganic. Ancient Mesopotamians used umbrellas; ancient Greeks, wide-brimmed hats. Along with various coverings, people applied concoctions to the body. In Africa, the use of ochre-based pastes, still used as sunscreen by people such as the Himba in Namibia, dates back at least 285,000 years, while the Roman writer Cornelius Celsus advised slathering the skin with olive oil.\nIt wasn't until the 19th Century, however, that scientists discovered ultra-violet radiation (UVR) – and realised that some ingredients, like quinine sulphate (derived from a tree bark), could absorb it. Scientists duly recommended it as a sunscreen. By 1930, researchers had found a number of other ingredients that absorbed UVR, including aesculin (from trees such as horse chestnut) and larch bark tannin. Though they wouldn't meet today's SPF standards, in terms of how they protected the skin, they all were organic (\"chemical\") sunscreens.\nLater, dozens of other ingredients were added to this list – including those produced by mixing together different substances in a laboratory to induce a chemical reaction. Often referred to as \"synthetic chemicals\", these types of ingredients – including avobenzone, oxybenzone, octisalate and octinoxate – have been found to absorb UV rays far more effectively than their predecessors. Another type of sunscreen came to market, too: \"mineral\" sunscreens.\nWhile they might seem more \"natural\", the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in today's sunscreens are usually lab-produced.\nAt first, it was thought that organic sunscreens absorbed UVR, while inorganic sunscreens physically reflected and scattered UVR away from the skin – a belief that was perpetuated further in a 1970s United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monograph.\nThis idea is still commonly heard today, including from seemingly authoritative sources. It also is partly why inorganic sunscreens sometimes are also called \"physical sunscreens\", implying that they block out UV rays like an umbrella deflects raindrops.\n\"People say that mineral or inorganic sunscreens reflect ultraviolet radiation,\" says Antony Young, professor emeritus of experimental photobiology at King's College London and a lifelong researcher of sunscreen efficacy. \"And that's not true.\"\nIn fact, modern titanium dioxide and zinc oxide only reflect or scatter 4-5% of the UV range, an authoritative, peer-reviewed 2015 study found. They absorb the other 95%.\nIndeed, scientists have been aware that inorganic sunscreens absorb UV since the 1980s – so much so that the authors of the 2015 study already seemed exasperated with having to provide even further proof. Their study emphasised \"yet again\", they wrote, \"that the true function of these insoluble 'physical' or 'mineral' UV filters is in fact identical to that of the soluble 'chemical' UV filters.\n\"These data indicate clearly that these filters act primarily as UV-absorbing materials, and not as UV-scattering or UV-reflecting materials.\"\nThey're not even actually \"reflecting\" that 5%, adds Diffey: \"They scatter it.\" UV rays aren't bounced off the surface of the inorganic particles. Instead, he says, \"the light rays go into the medium. They bounce around from the atoms or molecules. Some of them then will come back out again. And that's called scattering.\"\nMeanwhile, many sunscreens, even some marketed as \"mineral\", use both organic and inorganic UV filters.\nMost organic filters are soluble, meaning their active ingredients can be dissolved in a medium like water or oil\nBut in general, experts say, whether a UV filter works by absorbing, reflecting or scattering UVR doesn't really matter. The amount of heat generated in the skin by absorption is negligible – and a tiny fraction of the heat generated from the Sun's exposure itself.\nUltimately, says Mary Sommerlad, a consultant dermatologist based in London and British Skin Foundation spokesperson: \"You don't need to decide whether you want your UV energy to be absorbed or reflected, because they're working in pretty much the same way.\" That is, by reducing how much UVR your skin absorbs to protect it from damage and risk of developing cancer.\nIf organic and inorganic sunscreens work so similarly, why do they feel different?\nIt comes down to solubility. Most organic filters are soluble, meaning their active ingredients can be dissolved in a medium like water or oil. Inorganic sunscreens are not: their particles remain intact. As a result, inorganic sunscreens can feel thicker and give a white cast, while organic filters can provide smoother, clearer formulations.\nAs chemistry advances have shrunk inorganic particle sizes down, the white-cast effect has decreased. These \"nanoparticles\" (less than 100nm in size) of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide have led to their own set of concerns around skin penetration. But even this minuscule particle size doesn't penetrate more than the stratum corneum – the outermost skin layer – thus preventing systemic absorption.\nMost organic UV filters operate at the surface of the skin, too. Because sunburns develop at the upper layers of the skin, a UV filter must bind to the stratum corneum in order to work, say experts. Like inorganic sunscreens, therefore, organic sunscreens absorb the vast majority of UV at the skin's surface.\nBut it is true that some organic filtersaresystemically absorbed. \"Some active ingredients will find their way through to the bloodstream,\" says Diffey. \"Whether or not that's doing us any harm or not remains to be seen.\"\nSo far, there isn't good evidence that it is.\nThe vast majority of research finding risks of chemicals like oxybenzone has been performed on animals, using massive amounts. In one 2001 study that sparked concern about endocrine disruption, for example, baby rats were fed extremely large quantities of UV filters like oxybenzone for four days. Those that consumed oxybenzone had uteruses that were 23% larger than rats that didn't.\nBut when later researchers put these numbers into perspective, they found that – to reach the same systemic concentration of oxybenzone the rats had – a human would need to apply a 6% oxybenzone sunscreen every day… for 277 years.\nWhy are animals exposed to so much of a particular ingredient? Because it helps scientists determine the potential safety limit. \"The reason for these studies is to determine how much is safe,\" says Michelle Wong, chemist and author of the book The Science of Beauty who frequently tackles sunscreen myths online. As a result, \"they are always looking for an effect. They will generally use a large enough amount of the ingredient… to elicit some sort of effect.\n\"If they don't, then they don't know where the line is.\"\nSo far, the threshold at which the ingredients pose a risk seems to be many times higher than the quantity in which people are using them. One scientific review published earlier this year found no evidence that UV filters like avobenzone and homosalate can damage DNA or cause cancer in humans – and that blood levels of these chemicals from topical sunscreen are far below the amount at which they might have an effect.\nIn one 2004 study, for example, 32 people applied creams made up of 10% oxybenzone. Four hours after application, both men and women had slightly lower levels of testosterone. But after just four days of application, the differences between the appliers and the control group disappeared – leading the researchers to conclude that differences in the hormones weren't actually from the sunscreen itself.\nEven so, because ingredients like avobenzone are absorbed into the bloodstream, out of caution regulators like the FDA have requested more safety data from manufacturers.\nThe effects of organic filters on the environment – particularly coral reefs – are a little more unclear. Studies that have raised concerns have mostly been lab-based experiments; real-world impacts may be different. One study, for example, found that while UV filters were detected in the seawater across 19 tourist hotspots in Hawaii, 12 locations showed less than 10 parts per trillion of oxybenzone – the equivalent of 10 drops in a water-filled football stadium. The area with the highest concentration, Waikiki Beach, had 136 parts per trillion.\nAll were at levels far below the concentration at which the lab-based studies found damage to coral reefs. However, in 2018 Hawaii made the move to ban the sale of sunscreens containing chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate. \"If you have places with a high load of tourists going in, it is not unreasonable to stay cautious and say, 'Yes, there may be additive effects',\" marine scientist Jorg Wiedenmann said at the time.\nStill, while much of the focus regarding coral toxicity has been on organic UV filters, inorganic UV filters may have an effect too. Meanwhile, some marine biologists point out that the far larger (and better-proven) threat to corals is climate change – and that the biggest bleaching events have been in places without tourists.\nWhile scientists haven't yet proven any concrete, adverse effects to humans of using organic (or inorganic) sunscreens, aside from occasional side effects like allergic reactions, we can't say the same of excessive UV exposure. At worst, it can lead to skin cancer, the most common type of cancer in countries including the US and the UK. If it spreads, the deadliest type, melanoma, has only a 35% five-year survival rate.\nThis is why the best sunscreen, experts say, is one you are happy to use.\nFor some people, that is a sunscreen that is smoother, clearer and absorbs more quickly. For others, that might be a sunscreen that has fewer toxicology concerns, no matter how theoretical.\n\"SPF is SPF,\" says Young. \"It doesn't really matter what the ingredients are.\"",

If you go to a supermarket\r\nwith a child, these are the foods they will pick,” Muthoni says.\n\"Once developed, our front of package\r\nlabelling will indicate whether the particular foods are healthy or unhealthy\r\nbased on the nutrient content.\"\nKenya, led by the International Legislative Affairs in partnership\r\nwith the Ministry of Health, made a breakthrough this year and came up with the\r\ncountry’s nutrient profile model.\nIt is this nutrient profile model that will be used to decide if a\r\nproduct should have a front of pack warning label or not.\n“If a product does not exceed the threshold set on the NPM, then\r\nit will not have a front of pack warning label,” says IILA programme officer\r\nGideon Ogutu.\nThe NPM design adopted by the Kenya team is the octagonal shape,\r\nwith black and white colours.\n“It took a lot of effort for us to come up with an NPM because the\r\nfirst document had a lot of gaps that needed to be addressed,” Ogutu said.\n“And I want to thank the Ministry of Health for steering us to\r\nthis success. It is after MoH took over the process that we made headways and\r\nfinally came up with the NPM.”\nOne of the policies is the front of pack warning labels warning\r\nlabels (FOPWL) on products to inform consumers about potential health risks\r\nassociated with ultra-processed foods and beverages.\nThe labels are designed to make it easier for individuals to make\r\ninformed choices at the point of purchase, especially regarding items high in\r\nsaturated fat, sugar or sodium.\nThey are intended to prevent non-communicable diseases such as\r\ndiabetes, heart disease and obesity.\nSome countries such as Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Israel and\r\nArgentina have already implemented these labels on food products.\nKenya’s NPM model borrows from other countries with success\r\nstories as well as the WHO guidelines.\n“We settled on the octagonal shape because it is related to stop\r\nor a warning sign, which is basically what the warning labels are trying to\r\ncommunicate. The black and white colours are used because they are fairly\r\nneutral and relatable,” Ogutu said.\nAnne Swakei of the Non-Communicable Disease Alliance of Kenya says\r\nthe FOPWLs are not only important for persons living with diabetes, but other\r\nNCDs such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.\nShe says implementation of the labels will only be important if\r\nproper awareness and sensitisation are conducted.\n“Not everyone who lives with NCDs can read and write, and so it\r\nwill be important that once adopted, sensitisation campaigns be conducted by\r\nthe Ministry of Health and other partners,” Swakei says.\n“We also cannot assume that those who can read and write will\r\nautomatically understand what the front-of-pack warning labels are.

    "content": "Aedes mosquitoes are black with distinctive white or silvery markings and breed in containers such as tyres and tree holes.\nFor thousands of years malaria was a mysterious illness affecting people across the globe. Even the name of the disease, ‘malaria’, derived from two Italian words meaning ‘bad air’, highlights the confusion around the transmission of this disease. It was only following the discovery of malaria parasites in the gut of Anopheles mosquitoes in India bySir Ronald Rosson 20 August 1897that a clearer picture of the role of the mosquito in the malaria transmission cycle emerged.\nRoss was awarded a Nobel prize for this discovery, and since 1930 World Mosquito Day has been observed on 20 August to commemorate this important finding and highlight the role of mosquitoes in the health and well-being of humans.\nMosquitoes are among thedeadliest animalsin the world. Half of the deaths attributed to these insects are associated withmalaria. But mosquitoes are carriers of a number ofother parasites, viruses and nematodes (roundworms)that threaten the health of humans. It’s surprising, then, that the general public tends to be ill-informed about mosquitoes in general.\nThere are still many things scientists don’t understand either. For example, how do mosquitoesfind us? What do theylikeabout us? And why are some mosquitoes just a biting pest while othersare deadly? In addition,new mosquito speciesare still being described anddiscovered. Species previously not thought of as vectors are now being implicated in thetransmission of malaria.\nAs malaria research scientists we have chosen some interesting facts about mosquitoes to share with you. We also highlight what they mean for public health.\nMosquitoes are generally thought of as the noisy nuisance that pesters you at night. But they differ greatly in their biology and distribution. There are around 3,500 mosquito species belonging to five genera.\nThe whiny mosquito that instantly comes to mind is most likely a member of theCulexgenus, which is active at night. These mosquitoes lay their eggs as egg rafts in a range of different water bodies (breeding sites). They are associated with diseases like West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis in some regions, but not in South Africa.\nIn contrast,Aedesmosquitoesare mostly encountered during the day. These mosquitoes are black with distinctive white or silvery markings and breed in containers such as tyres and tree holes. They lay single eggs on the damp sides of a water body rather than directly onto water. These mosquitoes are capable of transmitting a range of deadly viruses including dengue, yellow fever and Zika.\nUnlikeAedesandCulexmosquitoes,Anophelesmosquitoesmake only a soft buzzing sound and hence are often referred to as the “silent killers”. Of the approximately 460Anophelesspecies, at least 70 have been implicated in malaria transmission. AdultAnophelesmosquitoes are brown or black with dappled wings and are generally most active between dusk and dawn. They also have a very distinctive resting posture, with their abdomens pointing away from a surface at an angle of about 45 degrees as opposed to resting parallel to the surface they are resting on. Female anopheline mosquitoes also lay single eggs on the surface of water bodies and hatched larvae lie parallel to the surface of the water.\nFemale anopheline mosquitoes interact with you when in search of a blood meal. They use the proteins in blood to assist with egg production. In her search for essential proteins, thefemale malaria mosquito bites– she doesn’t sting. Male malaria mosquitoes are harmless and play a critical role in the pollination of plants.\nToxorhynchitesmosquitoes, also known aselephant mosquitoes, do not have biting mouth parts. Their larvae are, however, actively carnivorous and eat other mosquito larvae. In certain conditions they have been used forbiological control.\nIt is also worth noting some mosquito look-alikes, notably crane flies. These large flies cannot bite, but arecommonly mistakenfor gigantic mosquitoes.\nDespite being associated with a wide range of diseases, mosquitoes are not capable of transmitting viruses such asHIV,Ebolaor thenovel coronavirus.\nMosquito-borne diseases are often preventable. But they are unfortunately associated with high levels of poverty and weak health systems. This makes controlling and preventing these diseases very challenging.\nIt is therefore very important to protect yourself from mosquito bites when in an area with a high risk of exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. Consider covering exposed areas of skin with repellents and sleeping under a mosquito net.\nThere are drugs which offer protection for travellers who haven’t been exposed to malaria before (which is most of South African population)  and, despite urban legend, they do not mask symptoms of the disease. If you develop  a fever after travelling to a malaria endemic area, you should tell  your healthcare provider where you have been.\nVaccines for yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis are available and several more are in development. There has been promisingmalaria vaccine newsbut  meanwhile it’s wise to take precautions.\nShüné Oliveris a Medical scientist at theNational Institute for Communicable Diseases.Jaishree Ramanis a Principal Medical Scientist and Head of Laboratory for Antimalarial Resistance Monitoring and Malaria Operational Research,National Institute for Communicable Diseases\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

This seems to conflict with the updated WHO advice. However, WHO’s advice is targeted at governments and health authorities rather than directly at parents.\nThe Australian dietary guidelines are underreviewand the latest WHO advice is expected to inform that process.\nIron is an essential nutrient for everyone but it is particularly important forbabiesas it is vital for growth and brain development. Babies’ bodies usually store enough iron during the final few weeks of pregnancy to last until they are at leastsix months of age. However, if babies are born early (prematurely), if their umbilical cords are clampedtoo quicklyor their mothers are anaemic during pregnancy, their iron stores may be reduced.\nCow’s milk isnot a good sourceof iron. Most infant formula is made from cow’s milk and sohas iron added. Breastmilk is also low in iron but much more of the iron in breastmilk istaken up by babies’ bodiesthan iron in cow’s milk.\nBabies should not rely on milk (including infant formula) to supply iron after six months. So the latest WHO advice emphasises the importance of giving babies iron-rich solid foods from this age. These foods include:\nYou may have heard that giving babies whole cow’s milk can cause allergies. In fact, whole cow’s milkis no more likelyto cause allergies than infant formula based on cow’s milk.\nThe latest WHO recommendation that formula-fed babies can switch to cow’s milk from six months could save you money. Infant formula can cost more than five times more than fresh milk (A$2.25-$8.30 a litre versus $1.50 a litre).\nFor families who continue to use infant formula, it may be reassuring to know that if infant formula becomes hard to get due to a natural disaster or some othersupply chain disruptionfresh cow’s milk is fine to use from six months.\nIt is also important to know what has not changed in the latest feeding advice. WHO still recommends infants have only breastmilk for their first six months and then continue breastfeeding forup to two years or more. It is also still the case that infants under six months who are not breastfed or who need extra milk should be fed infant formula.Toddler formulafor children over 12 months isnot recommended.\nAll infant formula available in Australia must meet the samestandardfor nutritional composition and food safety. So, the cheapest infant formulais just as good asthe most expensive.\nThe bottom line is your baby can safely switch from infant formula to fresh, full-fat cow’s milk from six months as part of a healthy diet with iron-rich foods. Likewise, cow’s milk can also be used to supplement or replace breastfeeding from six months, again alongside iron-rich foods.\nIf you need support with breastfeeding or starting solids, the Kenyan Ministry of Health'sDivision of Nutritioncan help.\nKarleen Gribbleis Adjunct Associate Professor, School of Nursing and Midwifery,Western Sydney University;Naomi Hullis PhD candidate, food security for infants and young children,University of Sydney, andNina Jane Chadis Research Fellow, University of Sydney School of Public Health,University of Sydney\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

    "content": "Viktor Gyokeres/ARSENAL\nViktor Gyokeres says he decided to sign for Arsenal after the Gunners thrashed his Sporting side 5-1 in the Champions League last season.\nThe 27-year-old Sweden striker has joined Arsenal in a deal worth up to 73m euros (£64m) on a five-year contract.\nThe move was held up because of negotiations between the clubs over additional payments, with the final agreement consisting of a 63m euro initial fee plus 10m euros in add-ons.\nGyokeres was in the Sporting side dismantled by Mikel Arteta's team in the group stage of Europe's top competition in November.\n\"I just felt it was the right club for me,\" said Gyokeres. \"What I heard from Mikel and [sporting director] Andrea Berta and just what I've seen in the past years, how they've been playing football.\n\"When I played against Arsenal last season, I could really feel it was a very strong team and very difficult to play against.\n\"That made me choose Arsenal, and of course all the history the club has and the massive fan base.\"\nThe move takes Arsenal's summer spending up to about £204m, following the arrivals of Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard, Noni Madueke and Cristhian Mosquera.\n\"Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels,\" said Gunners boss Arteta.\n\"He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat.\n\"We're excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to starting working with him.\"\nBBC Sport revealed at the start of the month how Arteta's side had turned their attentions to Gyokeres after hitting an impasse in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.\nGunners sporting director Andrea Berta flew to Lisbon to lead negotiations with the Portuguese club.\nThe deal concludes the long-running saga over Gyokeres' future, after he was linked with Manchester United earlier this summer.\nGyokeres failed to report back at Sporting for pre-season earlier this month, and the club's president Frederico Varandas said the player would face disciplinary action.\nThe former Brighton and Coventry striker has scored 97 goals in 102 matches and contributed 26 assists during his two seasons in Portugal to help Sporting claim two league titles.\nGyokeres returns to England on the back of a season in which he scored 54 goals in 52 games, including in the final of the Portuguese Cup as Sporting defeated Benfica 3-1.\nThe Swede also scored six times in the Champions League last season - including a hat-trick against Manchester City.\nGyokeres made his professional debut in 2015 in his native Sweden for IF Brommapojkarna.\nBy September 2017, he had caught the eye of newly promoted Premier League side Brighton and agreed a two-year contract with the Seagulls, officially joining the following January.\nWhile still playing for Brighton's youth team, he made his debut for Sweden in January 2019 in a defeat by Finland. He scored his first international goal three days later in a 2-2 draw with Iceland.\nHowever he still struggled for opportunities with Brighton and was sent on loan to German second-tier side St Pauli for the 2019-20 season.\nIt was at the Hamburg club where he began to thrive, scoring seven goals in 26 appearances.\nA month into the following season, Gyokeres scored his only Brighton goal - finding the net in a 4–0 League Cup victory over Portsmouth.\nNevertheless, weeks later he was loaned to Championship side Swansea City.\nHe played 12 times and managed one goal for the Swans during three months in Wales before being recalled by Brighton and sent on loan to Coventry City in January 2021.\nGyokeres scored three goals in the second half of the season, including his first league goal in English football, and made his move permanent that summer at the age of 23.\nDuring the next two seasons he would become one of the most prolific strikers in the Championship, scoring 43 goals in 116 appearances.\nIn 2022-23 he was named in the Championship team of the year as Coventry reached the play-off final, but were beaten on penalties by Luton Town.\nThat summer he moved to Portugal, signing for the Lisbon-based club for about £20m.",

Respect doesn’t mean retreat.”\nMcCarthy has worked with technical director Francis Kimanzi and a revamped backroom staff to blend structure with spontaneity.\nHis selections reflect merit, not legacy.\n“It’s not about what jersey you wore last year. It’s about what fire you carry today,” he said.\nA nation behind a team\nOutside the camp, the buzz is palpable. Street vendors sell Stars' jerseys alongside maize and mandazi.\nRadio talk shows dissect tactics with the intensity of courtroom arguments. Kenya, so often a nation of watchers, is now a stage for African football’s biggest drama.\nFootball Federation of Kenya (FKF) President Hussein Mohamed summed it best: “This is our tournament. Our moment. We have world-class stadiums, top talent, and the best fans on the continent.”\nIndeed, CHAN 2024 is more than just a tournament. It’s Kenya’s loudest statement in years.\nAs Benni’s boys march into the group of death, they do so with chins up and boots laced. In Nairobi, fear is not part of the game plan.",

    "content": "I seem to be writing a lot about Tottenham Hotspur this weekend. But with\r\na new coach and experimenting with pre-season team line-ups, it seems a good\r\nplace to start.\nIn a game against Reading, Thomas Frank played two teams,\r\nchanging at half-time. Here is an assessment of the new players and Frank’s\r\nstyle of management.\nCristiano Romero, more about him later in a separate item,\r\nled the first half team with Rodrigo Bentacur, Pedro Porro, Dominic Solanke\r\nand Brennan Johnson all trying but failing to break through Reading’s defence.\nCaptain Son Heung-min led the team out for the second half, and within four\r\nminutes, Spurs were in the lead. The new signings and one academy\r\ngraduate showed what they can do.\nMohammed Kudus took a corner and placed it\r\naway from the goalkeeper. Luka Vuskovic headed the ball on and Will Lankshear\r\nnodded in the goal. Nice work from the trio.\nKudus and Vuskovic linked up again\r\nwhen the midfielder pushed the ball onto the advancing Vuskovic, who slotted a\r\nperfect low shot into the corner of the net.\nFrank was pleased with his team’s first performance\r\nunder his guidance and greeted his players when they came off with his usual\r\nbig smile and charismatic father-like arm around shoulders. He has already won\r\nthe respect and approval of his players.\nVuskovic looked nervous as he started his Tottenham\r\ncareer, but grew into the game and the coach was clapping his skills. His goal\r\nand an assist are a good way to impress the new boss.\nKudus is going\r\nto be a big hit with the Tottenham faithful. He beat opponents with ease and\r\nfrequently created an assortment of excellent touches.\nThe Ghana international was playing against lower-division opposition, but he made some\r\nexciting runs down the wing, and Frank is delighted with his new signing, who will undoubtedly give Tottenham plenty of quality advancing upfield.\nIsak trains alone, wants options\nSeveral readers of this column have asked me why Newcastle’s Alexander Isak has been training alone this week.\nRelax Magpie supporters, it isn’t because the Swedish international has been demanding a wage rise to £300k a week, which would bust Newcastle’s pay structure and nor is it because his head has been turned by interest from Liverpool and the Saudi Pro League, although he is considering what options are open to him.\nIsak hurt his thigh in training after suffering with groin stress at the end of last season and it was painful enough for the club to send him for a scan, which fortunately did not reveal anything serious.\nCoach Eddie Howe decided that to protect his valuable striker, he would not train with the other players, which could have put him at risk until the thigh is healed. Indulging in rondos and tackling can get quite competitive in training and the coach works his players hard.\nOn the question of Isak leaving, Howe was quick to point out, “Alexander isn’t going anywhere, he is a very important and valuable member of our squad and he is not for sale.”\nIsak has told Newcastle that he would like to explore other options and is due to meet with Eddie Howe, however, the coach is determined to hold on to his prize asset.\nUnited getting their transfer window in order\nThe transfer merry-go-round continues without a pause. Manchester\r\nUnited will line up at the start of the season with Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.\r\nFortunately for the Red Devils, AC Milan have reported their interest in\r\nUnited’s striker Rasmus Hojlund and with Viktor Gyokores moving to the Emirates\r\nwith Arsenal, Benjamin Sesko and Nicolas Jackson are being carefully looked at\r\nby United’s recruitment department.\nAs I reported to you, Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro and\r\nLiam Delap, who have already made their presence felt for the Blues. Jackson is\r\nnow a third-choice striker but coach Enzo Maresca believes he can still turn him\r\ninto the £100m player Chelsea thought they were buying.\nA move away with either\r\na sale or loan is still possible and a bid by United would be seriously\r\nconsidered, but I think Nicolas could remain at Stamford Bridge, from what I have\r\nbeen told.\nMbuemo will have a contract with United until June 2031, which includes a year’s extension option. United have a tough opening Premier League\r\nmatch on  August 17 at home to Arsenal, which is a sell-out.\nNottingham\r\nForest are about to help out United by moving for Jadon Sancho, who has no future\r\nat Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim. Owner Evangelos Marinakis has agreed to provide the money to take Jadon to the City Ground, having lost Anthony Elanga\r\nto Newcastle.\nUnited’s former coach Erik Ten Hag has continued his\r\nhorrendous Old Trafford results failure in his new job at Bayer Leverkusen.\nAfter succeeding Xabi Alonso, following his move to Real Madrid,\r\nTen Hag has won only three of nine and suffered an embarrassing 5-1\r\nloss to Flamengo’s U20s.\nArsenal’s ace card if they go for Leipzig’s Simons\nIt almost seems strange to be talking so much about Arsenal\r\nand their transfer ambitions because, usually, they are quiet until making a\r\nsudden move to secure someone they have long been tracking.\nThe latest name on\r\nthe Emirates rumour machine is RB Leipzig’s forward Xavi Simons, but they might\r\nbe too late because Chelsea claim they have got him through the door at\r\nStamford Bridge. Leipzig missed out on Champions League football for next\r\nseason and face losing some of their best players.\nChelsea say they have signed him and he will likely be\r\njoined by Ajax defender Jorrel Hato, but they need to comply with their UEFA\r\nfine on spending going forward to play in the Champions League\r\ncompetition. That means selling.\nChelsea were fined £17million for failing to break even financially and a further £9.5million for spending more than 80 per cent of their revenue on transfers and wages. The situation is complicated and\r\nit will take a few days before everything becomes clear.\nThe link between Arsenal and Leipzig is strong\r\nand it might be possible to sign the striker, who previously played\r\nalongside new signing Noni Madueke and the two have kept in touch. Noni has\r\nspoken to Simons about coming to the Emirates but as things stand, he is going to Chelsea.\nThis is all in spite of Simons signing a contract in January.\r\nThe 22-year-old joined Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2023 before joining\r\nLeipzig on loan. The loan was made permanent for £41.9million. The Bundesliga\r\nclub would want that much if they sell, but for Arsenal, it would be less than\r\nCrystal Palace attacking midfielder and winger Eberechi Eze at £68million.\nLiverpool look very strong next season\nLiverpool have confirmed to me that they expect to complete\r\ncoach Arne Slot’s wish to bring 23-year-old Hugo Ekitike to Anfield for\r\n£79million after agreeing to a deal with Eintracht Frankfurt.\nHis transfer fee\r\nwill bring Liverpool’s summer spending to £270million, but the Reds are still actively\r\npursuing Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, who they want to partner Virgil van\r\nDijk in the heart of the defence.\nWhilst writing this, Ekitike will arrive at Anfield for a\r\nmedical for his six-year deal. The final giveaway sign that the Frenchman would\r\nbe coming to Liverpool was Eintracht boss Dino Toppmoller leaving him out of last Saturday’s defeat to FSV Frankfurt. Topmoller said, “He will be a\r\nbitter loss to this team.”\nEkitike hit 22 goals in\r\n48 games last season and helped Frankfurt qualify for the Champions League.\r\nLiverpool had originally hoped to lure Alexander Isak away from Newcastle but\r\nthat was always wishful thinking. Eddie Howe blocked the move.\nLiverpool hope to recoup some of their spending with the\r\nsale of Luis Diaz, who is determined to leave Anfield. Bayern Munich are putting\r\ntogether a £60m bid after their initial offer was rejected. The Colombian's representatives are talking to a few other clubs, but Bayern are in the driving\r\nseat.\nDarwin Nunez is wanted by Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal but he will be sold to whichever club bids the most. Other names I am told could be\r\nsold to balance the financial books are Harvey Elliott, Kostas Tsimikas or Andy\r\nRobertson, Ibrahima Konate and Federico Chiesa.\nFrank bombarded with questions at his introduction\nThomas Frank said in an honest interview that he knows his\r\nproud record of never having been sacked is at risk now that he has joined Tottenham\r\nHotspur.\nWorking for chairman Daniel Levy brings with it all sorts of demands\r\nfor the coach. Frank became the 14th manager at\r\nthe north London club since Levy’s reign, which spans a quarter of a\r\ncentury.\nPrevious coach, Ange Postecoglou, will testify to the “tough” challenge\r\nat the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He finished his first season high up the Premier\r\nLeague table and won Tottenham’s first trophy for decades when they beat\r\nManchester United in the final of the Europa League but he was then fired after\r\na disappointing season which saw them finish 17th.\nAt his long-awaited introduction to the press and supporters, Frank was bombarded with questions about the team, his ambition and how he will\r\nget the best out of the squad.\n“What\r\nis happening to captain Son Heung-min? (Frank said his future will be decided\r\nby the club and not the player himself). What is the latest on vice-captain\r\nCristian Romero and what is the progress in signing Nottingham Forest’s Morgan\r\nGibbs-White?” He was clearly swamped but remained silent on several issues\r\nwhich he said he could not comment on but were “good questions.”\nOne point did make me laugh…when it was pointed out that\r\nLevy had fired five managers during Frank’s time as Brentford manager. He replied,\r\n“Only five!” The man clearly has a sense of humour.\nLevy has said he wants the club to win the Premier League\r\nand Champions League, which puts enormous stress on Frank, but he said, “I share\r\nhis big ambitions for the club…A club of this size should have those ambitions, and how far away we are is very difficult to say. But we should throw it forward\r\nand go for it. No doubt that needs to be the aim for the future.”\nFrank still has several players working their way back\r\nto fitness but revealed that James Maddison is recovering from injury very well\r\nand should make the start of the season against West Ham on August 17.\nGrealish trains alone until deal is done\nJack Grealish’s representatives are working hard behind the\r\nscenes to arrange a transfer for the Manchester City forward. Grealish has been\r\nallowed to train alone at the Etihad facilities. He was left out of the City\r\nsquad when they played in the Club World Cup and had little\r\ncontact with either Pep Guardiola or his teammates during the past month.\nCity are prepared to take a substantial loss on the\r\n£100million they originally paid for him in the summer of 2021. Several\r\nenquiries have been made by Premier League clubs and a couple from Europe but\r\nall those have been for a loan arrangement, and City would prefer a sale.\nHis current salary of £300k-a-week is a stumbling block. Only a few clubs could afford that while a loan deal, with City footing a share of his wages, looks probable.\nGrealish is known in the dressing room as a “rest station.” His\r\nteammates opt to give him knowing he will keep possession or win a\r\nfree kick (I have lost count of the times I have seen him do that) and\r\ntherefore they can all take a few seconds' breather! That might be good for them, but it does not impress Guardiola.\nWhere should he move next? He came from Aston Villa, but\r\ncoach Unai Emery doesn’t seem like the ideal boss to make the most of his\r\ntalents. West Ham would make him welcome, but for my money, Everton. They have\r\nbeen revitalised under David Moyes, although his brand of football is not\r\nparticularly of the Grealish showman type, but they do have that added incentive\r\nof a new stadium, and the backing of the Premier League’s loudest supporters\r\nwould be immense.\nWelcome back to the Premier League, Sunderland\nIt is wonderful to see Sunderland back in the big time. A\r\nclub that, throughout the history of football, have played a huge part in our\r\nfavourite game.\nThe Black Cats started impressively with a 1-1\r\npre-season friendly draw at Spanish club Sevilla, who finished only\r\n17th in La Liga last season but are still a formidable\r\nopponent.\nRegrettably, their speedy midfielder, Romaine Mundle, was\r\ninjured in pre-match training and had to undergo an operation at the weekend.\r\nSunderland coach Regis Le Bris would not elaborate on Mundle’s injury but\r\nsaid it is hoped the 22-year-old would be training for the start of the season.\nAttacking forward Armand Lauriente travelled by private jet\r\nto meet his new teammates after Sunderland arranged a deal with Sassuolo for\r\n£17.5million.\nHe watched the draw with Sevilla after completing his medical, but\r\nthen the deal collapsed when personal terms could not be agreed. Sunderland are\r\ncontinuing their search to strengthen their attacking positions.\nI am hearing whispers linking ex-Arsenal midfielder Granit\r\nXhaka to the Stadium of Light but Bayer Leverkusen are determined to keep him\r\nand this transfer will prove difficult. Regis Le Bris is now concentrating on\r\nstrengthening his backline and bringing in a new centre-back is a priority.\nEintracht Frankfurt meet Man City’s McAtee\nEintracht Frankfurt have refused to pay a club record fee\r\nfor Manchester City’s 22-year-old England Under-21 captain James McAtee.\nHe\r\nflew to Germany on Monday for discussions with the Bundesliga club and was\r\ntaken on a tour of the stadium and training facilities.\nCity have placed a £25million asking price on McAtee but\r\nFrankfurt have rejected that and although they are still in touch with his\r\nrepresentatives, they are now looking at Freiburg’s Ritsu Doan although the City\r\nman is still their preference if they can get the price reduced.\nThank you from injured Bellingham\nJude Bellingham has undergone an operation on his arm and he\r\nleft the hospital in London last week with it in a sling. He will be unlikely to\r\nreturn to the Real Madrid squad for three months but sent out an Instagram\r\nmessage, “Thank you, everyone at Fortius Clinic, for the hospitality and to\r\neveryone else for all the well wishes and messages of love.”",

However, I was pleased with the time I finished with and also winning in my\r\nfirst race of the season.”“Before the race, the favourite to win was Laso, but I was able to outkick him and silence all the critics,” he added.China was next in line, where Matata reeled off\r\nback-to-back wins, first in Meishan (59:28), dusting off Tanzania’s Alphonce\r\nSimbu (1:01:05) and compatriot Timothy Kiplagat (1:01:06).He followed it up with another triumph in Yangzhou, winning\r\nin 59:31, ahead of Ethiopians Gerba Dibaba (1:00:08) and Abduljelil Abdulwokil\r\n(1:00:10).“The races in China were good and the weather was also\r\ngood. The only challenge was the food; I was not used to that kind of food.\r\nThey have a very different cuisine from what we are used to here in Africa.”His winning streak extended to Istanbul on April 27,\r\nclocking 59:40 against a competitive field with Ethiopia’s Berehanu Tsegu\r\n(1:00:47) and compatriot Shadrack Kendaywo (1:01:28) in second and third place.“I knew the race won’t be easy, but in every race I\r\nwalk into, I am always psychologically prepared to tackle any challenge.”Coached by John Litei, Matata is now ranked 14th\r\nglobally over the 21km this season.Yet he isn’t content with road dominance alone.On June 26, he tested his legs on the track at the\r\nNational Championships, clocking 13:50.91 for fourth place in the 5,000m for\r\nKenya Prisons Service.Gilbert Kiprotich (13:37.06), Amos Kiprotich\r\n(13:37.58) and George Manangoi (13:43.03) completed the podium places.“The track is not bad, my body responded very well.\r\nI was targeting 13:40, but the time I got was also very good.\" Aftertesting his mantle on the track, Matata sees a\r\nbright future for himself over the 10,000m, to follow in the footsteps of his\r\nrole model Ndiku.“I see a future in the 10,000m. I want to do more on\r\nthe track this season and also next season with the hope of representing the\r\ncountry in international competitions one day and following in Ndiku’s big\r\nfootprint.”But road running remains his hunting ground.With his management team, Posso Sports, Matata eyes\r\nthe Copenhagen and Valencia Half Marathons later in the year.“My management is working on getting me to the\r\nCopenhagen and Valencia Half Marathons later on in the year.”He believes the Valencia course offers the\r\nperfect platform for him to attack his personal best.“I have never run in Valencia, but I know it is a\r\nfast course. If I run there, I am very sure I can lower my personal best to 58\r\nor probably 57 minutes,” he said.Born on July 27, 1997, in Katangi, Yatta, Machakos\r\nCounty, Matata, the second born in a family of five boys, recalls how his passion\r\nfor running was sparked by stories of his late father, himself a running\r\nenthusiast, told by his mother, Rose Matata Kiamba, after his father’s passing\r\nin 2007.“My father died in 2007 while I was still very\r\nyoung. My mother would tell us stories of him and how he used to run, and that\r\nsparked a flame within me,” he recalls.The tales of his late father not only inspire\r\nhim, but his brother Charles Matata too.Charles is also a half-marathon runner, boasting\r\nvictories from Beijing 2025 (1:00:25) and back-to-back triumphs in Venlo from\r\n2024 (1:00:39) and 2025 (1:00:36).Ndiku’s Beijing heroics further ignited young Matata’s\r\nflame.“I remember I was herding cows when I heard the news\r\nof Ndiku, that inspired me, and I wanted to be like him one day and\r\nachieve what he was able to in Beijing.”Matata joined Kakunike Primary in Katangi, after\r\nwhich he switched to Kisaani Primary due to school fee complications.In his school days, Matata had mastered the 3,000m\r\nand 10,000m distances.It was, however, while at Mekilingi High School that\r\nhis talent truly blossomed, representing his school in regional competitions.His talent would catch the eye of Coach Dennis\r\nMuthusi, who took him into his Machakos training camp, where he would hone his\r\nskills during the holidays.In 2017, Matata would meet with his role model, Ndiku, and this proved a turning point in his life.“In 2017, while I was in Form Three, Ndiku came to\r\nvisit us in camp. It was a very big moment for me. He told me that I was\r\ntalented and motivated me. That for me was a life-changing encounter.”However, Matata’s schooling journey was not without\r\nits hurdles. Raised by a single mother, Matata recalls that school fees became\r\na challenge.“Being raised by a single mother was a big challenge, more so when it comes to paying school fees. My brother Charles and I used to\r\nsell firewood so we could assist our mother in getting money to cater for our\r\nschool fees.”“Proper running shoes also proved a challenge for\r\nme. You have to have proper running shoes for long distances, hence you risk\r\nbeing injured.”In 2018, inspired and determined, Matata stormed to\r\nvictory in the 3,000m at the National School Games and placed third in the\r\n10,000m.Yet a family crisis robbed him of a chance to\r\ncompete at the East African Games.“Ndiku’s motivation struck a chord within me, and in 201,8 I won the national 3,000m and finished third in the 10,000m.\r\nHowever, I could not represent my school at the East African Games because of\r\nsome challenges back home.”Muthusi later linked him up with coach Litei in\r\nEldoret, where he honed his craft.“Muthusi introduced me to Litei after the nationals, and because Machakos was not that favourable for long-distance training, I\r\nswitched to Eldoret.”But in 2022, a stress fracture sidelined him for a\r\nyear, a dark chapter where he resorted to washing clothes at camp to make ends\r\nmeet.“I got a stress fracture on my leg, which kept me out\r\nfor a whole year. I pushed my body too much, so it could not hold hence the\r\ninjury. It was a very big challenge because I had taken up running to support\r\nmy family. I used to wash clothes at camp so I could get some money to send to\r\nmy family back home.”Matata rebounded in 2024 with a stunning half-marathon\r\ndebut win in Padova (59:37).Matata, however, bounced back in 2024, opening his\r\nseason with an emphatic win in his maiden half marathon appearance in Padova\r\n(59:37).“In that race, I was hungry for a win, and I wanted to\r\nmake a statement and announce my arrival in the half marathon.”He extended that top form in his next appearances,\r\nwinning in Bucharest (1:00:04) and Antrim Coast (59:46) before finishing second\r\nin New Delhi (59:53) behind two-time Olympic gold medallist Joshua Cheptegei of\r\nUganda (59:46).“When I was heading to that race, I was not feeling\r\nvery well. I was to cancel, but my management pushed me to continue with the\r\nrace.”“I hit 10K at 27:57, and at that time, Cheptegei was\r\nbehind me. However, as we approached the finish, my body started failing me, and\r\nCheptegei came past me and ended up winning. It was my very first time running\r\nagainst Cheptegei.”He, however, bounced back in his final race of the\r\n2024 season in Al Khobar, winning in 1:00:17 ahead of Ethiopia’s Adisu Negash\r\n(1:00:21) and Nicholas Kipkorir (1:00:23).\nIn a country where distance running legends are born\r\nby the dozen, it takes something extraordinary for an athlete to rise above the\r\ncrowd.\nHowever, 27-year-old Alex Matata is quietly carving\r\nout his niche, a relentless assassin on the Half Marathon circuit and a rising\r\nforce in Kenya’s distance running ranks.\nMatata draws deep inspiration from one of Kenya’s\r\ntrack warriors, 2015 World 5,000m silver medallist Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku, a man\r\nwho once dared to stare down Mo Farah on the grandest stage.\nAt the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, Ndiku\r\npushed Farah to the brink before the Briton unleashed his famous kick to snatch\r\ngold in 13:50.38, with Ndiku claiming a hard-fought silver in 13:51.72at the Beijing National Stadium.\nNdiku, nicknamed 'The Buffalo', holds accolades\r\nspanning both continental and global championships.\nHis trophy\r\ncabinet further includes the 2014 Commonwealth Games 5,000m title from Glasgow\r\n(13:12.07), the 2011 All-African games 1,500m title from Maputo (3:39.12), two\r\nAfrican Championship titles from Porto Novo 2012 (1,500m –3:35.71)\r\nand Marrakech 2014 (5,000m –  13:34.27) as well as the 2014 African\r\nContinental Cup 3,000m title (7:52.64).\nMatata is slowly scripting his own story, having\r\nbeen undefeated since lacing up his shoes for the 2025 season.Undefeated over the half marathon this season, he\r\nannounced his intent in style on February 1 at the Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon\r\nin the UAE, blasting to a personal best 59:20 afteroutkicking Ethiopia’s Gemechu Dida (59:29) and\r\nIsaia Lasoi (59:26).\n“This year has so far been a blessing to me since\r\nkicking off my campaign in February. My first race was in Ras Al Khaimah, and I\r\nwas well prepared for it psychologically. My body was feeling good, and I was\r\nvery much confident heading into the race,” Matata recalls.“My target going into the race was to lower my\r\npersonal best and win to get my season off to a flying start.”\nWith the pack intact up to the 15km mark, Matata\r\nfelt the moment and struck for the win.“We were in a pack of seven athletes up to the 15km mark.\r\nI felt my body was in good shape, so I decided to break away and go for the\r\nwin,” he said.\nHeading into that race, Matata had set for himself a\r\nbold 58:09 target.

This keeps our\r\nlove for the game, which brought us\r\ntogether, alive,” Gachie said.\nThis love for tennis, combined\r\nwith a shared purpose, led them to\r\nform Courtside Care—a programme\r\nwith a vision of “a racket in every\r\nhand, a dream in every mind, and\r\nthe means to achieve it.”\nGachie, 17, explained the\r\nmotivation behind Courtside\r\nCare:\n“We believe talent shouldn’t\r\nbe hindered by barriers. Many\r\nyoung players from underserved\r\ncommunities show promise. “\n“We chose tennis after observing\r\nmany talented players from\r\nunderprivileged communities\r\nexcelling in the sport. Imagine\r\nwhat they could achieve with\r\ncoaching, equipment and support\r\nfor tournaments.”\n“Courtside Care is a way for us to\r\nprovide underprivileged kids with tennis rackets, weekly coaching\r\nsessions and financial support to\r\nregister for tournaments as well as\r\ntravel assistance for players who\r\nqualify for African tournaments.”\nAbdul, 18, highlighted the values\r\nthat tennis instilled in them, noting\r\nthat others could benefit too.\n“We have seen first-hand how\r\naccess to sports can shape lives.\r\nTennis gave us discipline, confidence\r\nand community.

Some corporates we approached hesitated, as this was\r\nour first event,” he said.\n“Raising the funds for the\r\ntournament was such a tough order.\r\nWe were relying mainly on our\r\nfriends and families,” Abdul said.\nThey were, however, thankful\r\nto Chandarana FoodPlus and\r\nBrookside — who offered essential\r\nsupport with food packs.\n“We want to say a big thank you\r\nto Chandarana and Brookside for\r\ncoming in to sponsor us during\r\nthe tournament by providing food\r\nand milk packs for the kids to take\r\nhome,” Gachie said.\nThe trio aims to make the next\r\ntournament, in July 2025, even\r\nbigger.\nThey target Sh2m.\nThey plan to introduce entrance\r\nfees for their events and lure\r\nmore sponsors, which will help\r\nboost the prize money thus\r\nattract more players.\n“We have had a feel of what\r\nputting together a successful\r\ntournament entails.

First and foremost, there is a need for a robust \r\nsupport system that encompasses coaching, training facilities, and \r\nfinancial backing.\n\" The role of sports federations and government agencies in providing \r\nthe necessary infrastructure cannot be understated.

Photo ILRI.In predicting weather conditions and climate forecasting, Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) offer a granular, cost-effective approach to climate forecasting that often surpasses conventional meteorology.\nFor instance, in Western Kenya’s sacred Nganyi forest shrine, elders study the behaviour oftsiswaants and the delayed flowering ofmuyeyetrees with the same scientific precision their ancestors used for generations.\nWhile satellite screens displayed predictions of minimal rainfall during last season’s devastating drought, these traditional forecasters correctly warned of a different pattern—a false start followed by violent deluges.\nThis scene, playing out across the Horn of Africa, reveals a profound truth: the future of climate resilience lies not in choosing between ancient wisdom and modern technology, but in their intelligent fusion.\nThe Precision of Traditional Knowledge is also portrayed by Afar pastoralists in Ethiopia who have developed sophisticated methods based on observing livestock behaviour, star constellations, and plant phenology to guide crucial seasonal migrations.\nFurther South, Maasai elders assess rainfall prospects by examining fat deposits around cattle kidneys and monitoring the flowering patterns of indigenous plants like theOloirientree.\nTo ensure these methods are not conjecture, research supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) demonstrates that traditional forecasts in Ethiopia and Kenya can predict rainfall onset with 94 percent confidence and forecast volume with 84 percent accuracy—rates that frequently exceed conventional meteorology for specific micro-climates.\nDr Joyce Kimutai, a leading Kenyan climate scientist and IPCC author, explains: “This isn't about discarding meteorological science. It's about enriching it. Indigenous knowledge gives us historical and geographical granularity that satellites simply cannot provide.”\nFurthermore, the synergy between indigenous and scientific knowledge is already saving lives as ICPAC facilitates forums where satellite data and indigenous forecasts are discussed together, creating consensus-based outlooks broadcast through local radio networks in vernacular languages.\nCase in point, the Kenya Meteorological Department now blends traditionalNganyifamily predictions with scientific forecasts, producing more accurate and culturally trusted weather information for Western Kenya communities.\nThis means that traditional forecasters provide location-specific information while meteorological data offers broader regional patterns, creating a comprehensive early warning system that communities trust and use.\nNevertheless, the challenge lies in transforming promising pilot projects into a regional doctrine. IGAD Executive Secretary Dr Workneh Gebeyehu recognizes that the region’s peace and stability are fundamentally linked to climate resilience.\n“A truly resilient Horn of Africa requires formal frameworks integrating traditional and scientific knowledge systems,” he reiterates.\nDr. Gebeyehu notes that this integration demands deliberate investment in elder-youth mentorship programs to preserve knowledge and empowering women's cooperatives as primary disseminators of climate information, and weaving indigenous wisdom into educational curricula.\n“Regionally, establishing an IGAD Traditional Forecaster Network would formalize collaboration between traditional experts and national meteorological agencies,” he assures.\nMeanwhile, charting the path forward, the ultimate shield against climate change will not emerge from laboratories alone, but from the convergence of two powerful knowledge systems.\nAs communities across East Africa face increasingly volatile weather patterns, the marriage of ancient observational methods with modern scientific tools offers the most promising pathway to resilience.\nThe vision is clear: a Horn of Africa where a pastoralist’s observation in Somalia for example, enriches regional climate models that protect farmers across the region and where traditional/scientific research hubs drive climate response.\nThis convergence represents more than meteorological innovation—it embodies a fundamental recognition that sustainable climate adaptation must honour both scientific advancement and indigenous heritage, creating forecasting systems that are not only accurate but also culturally resonant and community-trusted.",

    "content": "I’m probably destined to never understand women. Armed with a mere pistol, my wife Sgt Sophia will face a gang of robbers armed thieves and never back down unless she’s truly cornered and runs out of ammo.\nThe same woman occasionally visits Kericho town, where another woman, probably a sadist by all means, pours hot wax on my wife’s nether regions and then yanks out the hair by the roots. Yet, Sophia is deathly afraid of spiders.\nThis wife of mine also knows I, too, legally own a lethal weapon, and will still lie to my face. Last week, she suggested that we should go to the coast to work on our flailing relationship.\nShe even goes a step further to suggest the exact date we should do this, which is in about a month’s time. I’m all excited until I see an official memo from the higher-ups announcing a police retraining seminar in Mombasa. Guess when that is happening? You’re right. In a month’s time!\n“Is what you meant by us taking a holiday to work on our marriage?” I ask, waving the memo in her face.\n“What’s that?” She takes the sheet and scans through it. From the look on her face, she might be reading a brand-new release from John Kiriamiti. “I hadn’t seen this. When did it come?”\n“When did… What do you mean when did it come? Your signature is on it, meaningyoureceived it.”\nShe shrugs.\n“You know how it is with paperwork. I probably didn’t even read it.” She beams. “Quite an auspicious coincidence, isn’t it? Now the state gets to recompense for our holiday.”\nAuspicious recompense, my backside! She likes using big words, especially when she’s trying to put one over me. Or when she’s mad at me and can’t explain exactly why.\nShe knows I’m too proud to ask for the meaning of a term in the moment, and I’d have to rely on Google later. By then, it’s too late for any reasonable comeback.\n“Forget about not telling me about it now,” I push on. “What would you have said come the day we have to leave? When I would know we’re going for a conference?”\nHer eyes narrow to slits. I’m about to be accused of something.\n“Have you thought that maybe that’s my way of saying I’m willing to work on our marriage? It doesn’t matter if we do it at a conference or at a hajji to Mecca. I don’t know about you, but when I am willing to solve an issue, I’d do anywhere. I would learn how to ride a unicycle at the top of Mt Everest if that’s what it took.”\nLike I said, I don’t think I’ll ever understand women. Even before launching this latest argument with her, I knew she would win, like she always does.\nI remember one day we were arguing about who should make coffee in the morning.\n“You should do it,” she said. “You always get up before me.”\n“Nope,” I hit back. “I’m the husband and you’re the wife. It’s your job to cook and so you should make the coffee.”\nShe shook her head.\n“Not coffee. It’s even in the bible.”\nShe must be lying. Nowhere in the good book does the word “coffee” appear. At least I didn’t think so.\n“You want to bet?” she asked. “If I’m right, you make coffee from now on.”\n“Deal,” I said.\nShe opens the bible, flips to the New Testament and points to the top of the page. Sure enough, there it was — HEBREWS.\nAnd that’s how I ended up making breakfast every morning.",

    "content": "Lonely woman / PIXABAYMy husband and I have been having this debate for the last few years that we have lived as economic migrants in a different country.\nMy husband and I have been having this debate for the last few years that we have lived as economic migrants in a different country.\nEven though we come from two different African countries (I from the East, him from Central), we met and spent most of our twenties in the  southernmost part of the continent. As such, our values and life in general have changed because they were largely influenced by the environment we lived in.\nAs Africans, we might have minor differences in our cultures and traditions, but the norms of society remain largely the same. We are kind to our neighbours, we are friendly to everyone, we are ready to help and most importantly, we value community. The same cannot be said for our Western counterparts.\nIn the West, community is the extended family, community is your church group, community is your dedicated group of friends. As a result, since our moving here, I have felt the impact of my loss of community. My husband and I live in a foreign land that speaks a foreign language with our three-year-old for company. We occasionally meet and interact with friends, but it's just not the same.\nWe could spend weeks before we run into any neighbours, and when we do, a simple “hello” suffices. The neighbours from the street will either greet you or ignore you, but one thing is for certain, you will never have the type of neighbourliness where you visit each other or rely on them for anything.\nMy husband isn’t bothered much by this as he is introverted and maintains a small social circle. He claims to have adapted by doing what the Romans do. Meanwhile, I find myself stifled and losing my own instincts of how to act in public. Let me expound by example.\nI have lived in the same building for three years. The neighbours are the same. I go to the same supermarket weekly. I get served by the same cashiers, one of whom has a child who is Kindergarten classmates with mine. I go to the same doctor’s office often, same pediatrician and so on… but none of them have ever spoken to me.\nI mean reallyspeak, not even about the weather. There is no conversation in the society we are in, just people reading off a script. “Hello.” “Your bill is…” “Do you have your insurance card?” “Please wait in the waiting room.”\nI mean, I know these people and they know me. Yet if they see me on the street, they will turn their heads. Even throughout our entire interaction, a formal discourse will be maintained.  There is no warmth or friendliness with people here. When they do strike up some sort of conversation, it would end up being about your foreignness and your background.\nI have lost my ability to make small talk. When I am in Kenya, I find it hard to connect to other people the way I used to. I feel that a part of my identity and culture is slowly being erased because of my current environment. I force myself to do things that have been instilled in me even though I fear rejection or being chastised.\nLast week, my neighbour lost her mother. Why is it that in a building of seven homes (most of whom are homeowners and lived as neighbours for years), my husband and I were the only ones to show up at the funeral? Is this really the society I want to live in? Even though I have chosen to immigrate to a different country for multiple reasons, do I really need to lose myself because I am in Rome and must do what the Romans do?",

    "summary": "Growth is not sudden or loud. It is been quiet and steady",
    "content": "Poetry book / PIXABAYEarly this week, I noticed a lemon plant growing defiantly through a crack in the pavement of the superhighway. I saw something of myself. And I daresay, I saw something of us all. You. Me. Them. We who live quietly. We who work diligently. We who survive between the cracks of this or that kind, hither and thither.\nI have been alive for 46 years. The earth has orbited thesun46 times with me clinging to its back. And in this reflective stillness, I do not think about how far I have come. Have I, really? No. I think about how I have changed.\nLike that lone lemon plant, I have learned that life does not always offer fertile ground. Sometimes, we do not get planted in red loam or black cotton soil of well-tended gardens. Sometimes, we find ourselves in the margins, rooted in hard places, pushed aside by the roaring noise of Earth. And yet, like that fragile plant, we grow. We stretch toward the light, even when the odds are against us.\nMy growth has not been sudden or loud. It has been quiet and steady. Step by step, stage by stage, phase by phase. Not by might. Not by brilliance. But by patience. By the slow unfolding of self-awareness and grace. That, in itself, is a kind of strength.\nI have come to see that we are all teachers, even those among us who do not stand before blackboards. We teach by how we carry ourselves. We teach by what we endure and how we choose to endure it. Every hardship we survive is a chapter in someone else’s guidebook. Every kindness we offer is a small light in someone else’s dark hour. Every mistake we make, and learn from, is a lesson made real. These are the teachings written in the ink of experience, shaped by sense and feeling, by thought and the holy guesswork of living.\nOne lesson stands out above the rest: the value of yielding. Just like that lemon plant that bends with the wind rather than snapping beneath it, I, too, have learned to yield. To listen more and argue less. To adapt rather than resist for the sake of pride. To soften where I used to harden. There is strength in flexibility. Wisdom in knowing when to let go.\nI have come to admire rainwater. There is a deep truth in how it flows, how it adapts to every shape and finds a way around every obstacle. In Chinese philosophy, water is revered for this very reason. It does not force its way. It does not shout. But it carves canyons and shapes continents. There is a lesson there for us human beings.\nAt 46, I see more clearly what matters and what doesn’t. I’ve lost some things and gained others. I’ve let go of the need to impress, the hunger for applause and the fear of slowing down. In their place, I’ve found quietness, gratitude and a deeper joy in simply being present.\nI have learned that the best things in life are not complex. Community is not complex. Simplicity is not complex. Empathy is not complex. These are the things that hold us together. These are the things that make life livable. No, beautiful.\nLove, shared simply.Laughter, heard freely.Life stories, told without shame.Meals, eaten slowly, with others.\nI have come to believe deeply in community. In the simple, everyday gestures that say: “You are not alone.” A neighbour who recalls your name. A friend who checks in. A student who gains from a teacher’s spontaneous anecdote. These are the treasures we should count.\nAnd empathy, yeah, empathy, is the bridge we must build every day. Everyone is carrying something. Everyone is wounded somewhere. We must stop judging people by the chapter we walked in on. We must make room for each other’s shadows. The world is too cruel already. We must not add to it.\nSo, I say this to you, wherever you are planted, grow. Even when the soil is dry. Even when no one notices. Even when your roots crack the concrete. Grow anyway. Be like the lemon plant. Quiet. Resilient. Alive.\nLive simply.Love generously.Forgive quickly.Listen deeply.Laugh loudly.\nRemember where you come from. The labour-cries of our mothers in the maternity ward. The hands that taught us our names to write. Voices that sang us to sleep when we were still small and afraid. Let your life honour their sacrifice.\nYes let us remain soft. Not soft as in weak but soft as in kind. Soft as water. Soft as in strong enough to bend, gentle enough to heal.\nThis is my 46th gospel.This is my epiphany.\nMay we continue to grow where we are planted.May our roots, though hidden, stay intertwined. Quiet and strong beneath the surface of our ordinary lives.May we rise, as Phoenix do, each passing year, with a little more grace, a little more laughter, and a lot more love.\nAluta continua.",

    "summary": "A Gen Z uprising triggered by the Finance Bill 2024 has spawned wave of mid-year protests\nKnown as 'maandamano', they make for riveting news, but push photojournalists to the limit",
    "content": "A teargas canister explodes in the hand of a protester who wanted to throw it back to police officers on Tom Mboya Street, Nairobi during the anti-Finance Bill protests in Nairobi on July 2 last year / ENOS TECHEEver since thousands of Gen Zs took to the streets to fight new taxes last year, ‘maandamano’ has become a recurring nightmare for President William Ruto around the budget season.\nA Tifa poll at the time found 81 per cent of Kenyans supporting the youths. However, most people retreat to the safety of their homes whenever a rallying cry is issued.\nFor photojournalists, duty calls. The Star’s Douglas Okiddy, Leah Mukangai and Enos Teche rush to the epicentre in Nairobi, getting there via boda boda as matatus keep off the roads.\nThey find a ghost town blockaded by police. ButGen Zs are undaunted. After mobilising on X (Twitter), they march to the city centre, waving placards and the Kenyan flag.\nThey sing and dance and play football on the streets, TikToking and Insta Storying their journey.\nWhen they get to town, a rude welcome greets them. Tear gas is lobbed and water cannons blasted.\nThey barely disperse before regrouping and recharging, hurling stones and burning tyres. “Ruto must go!” they chant.\nOkiddy, Mukangai and Teche duck and dash while taking snaps,“with no appropriate gear apart from a press card for identification and a handkerchief to protect you from tear gas”, Teche says.\nCops harass journalists, viewing their photos and footage as potentially incriminating. Protesters can also be hostile, fearing for their safety if featured in the media.\nThugs armed with knives and pangas infiltrate the protests, looting, burning and mugging. Andmotorcycle gangs, allegedly hired by politicians, ride around the city, brandishing whips and clubs to scare off protesters.\nThe air is thick with tension. Okiddy psyches himself up by taking it as a normal working day. Mukangai is jittery as it’s a baptism of fire for her. Teche, meanwhile, is resilient, having suffered loss and harm in the past.\n“God is the only one who can protect you during these maandamanos,” Okiddy says.\nMukangai wishes they could work freely without being targeted. “It would make it easier for us to deliver and give our best in the field.”\nTeche says there is no manual on how to navigate the riots. “You have toread the street like a language,” he says. “You learn to identify plainclothes police by their stance, the way they talk into their shoulders. You spot goons by the adrenaline in their eyes. And you know when to exit.”\nThe trio witness a full day of running battles as democracy dances with anarchy, leaving the city looking like a war zone.\nCoughing and tearing in lingering fumes,theyfile their hard-earned photos. Each picture is worth a thousand words. They are published online and the most iconic is splashed on the front page the next day. A record of blood, sweat and tears frozen in time.\n“No photojournalist takes pride in covering protests showing his country burn,” Teche says poignantly. “We all live and work in this country.”\nSTAYING NEUTRAL\nDouglas Okiddy finds maandamano more intense than rallies, which challenged him the most before.\n“Last year’s protest was huge,” he says of the climax on June 25, when Gen Zs stormed Parliament. “People are reading the law and becoming more enlightened.”\nHisjourney to journalism started in high school, inspired by the memories captured in ‘funkies’ (school functions) and the black-and-white pictures in history books.\nHe learned the ropes with the media team of an organisation he joined after high school, before studying mass communication and video production in college.\nHe interned with radio and TV stations then joined the Star in 2015, first as an entertainment photographer before transitioning to the general news desk in 2019.\nThrough his work, he has travelled locally and internationally, met VIPs and attended career- defining seminars.\n“My family, relatives and friends think I am rich and famous,” he says with a laugh.\n“The passion I have for photography is massive despite the challenges we face in our daily livelihoods.”\nWhen deployed to maandamano, he prays to God for protectionand visualises how his shots should look before hitting the streets.\nHe takes a light breakfast, wears comfortable clothes and shoes, andonly carries essential items in his backpack: camera, notebook and water. Thus, he is fleet-footed and able to wash tear gas off his face.\nOnce on the ground, he greets police with a smile but avoids demonstrators.\n“Don’t engage with protesters even if you see your girlfriends,” he warns. “You are supposed to be as neutral as possible.”\nWhen police and protesters clash, he positions himself centrally, where he can see everything and everyone. He shifts depending on where he can get a good shot.\nA picture may be just a click away, but he takes it with the public in mind. “You need to be composed, accurate and focused to ensure no words will explain better than the image you take,” he says.\nWary of goons, he looks all round for an escape route. “It’s good to be confident when they happen to be around you,” he says. “Just look them in the eye and say, ‘I’m also at work like you.’”\nHe captured the point-blank shooting of a face mask hawker during protests on June 17, and it was run in a collage on the front page of the Star the next day.\n“Never in my school days did I think I would have four or five photos in the newspaper,” Okiddy says thankfully. “Let alone getting a page-one photo.”\nSTAGE FRIGHT\nAt just 4’11” and 48kg, Leah Mukangai is but a baby girl in a big boys’ world.\nShe found the invasion of Parliament last year scary. “It was a matter of life and death,” she says.\nMukangai studied mass communication in university and majored in broadcast. “Contrary to what I’m doing today, I loved being in front of the camera,” she says with a sunny smile.\nAs an introvert, she shied away from people, butshe practised photography with friends at a few events after her mum bought her her first camera,gradually gaining courage.\nHer career began with digital marketing for a real estate company, posting photo and video content on social media to woo clients. She then moved to the Star in 2023.\nBefore the protests, her toughest assignment was to cover a fire at Hillside Endarasha Primary School, which killed 21 children in September last year.\n“I was ambushed to travel to Nyeri. What I encountered left me in distress,” Mukangai narrates sorrowfully.\n“Seeing parents and guardians helpless and in tears was the saddest thing. At some point, I was torn between continuing my work and consoling the parents.”\nMukangai believes a picture is a powerful visual. “It gives emotions and details of what the photographer is trying to convey to the audience,” she says.\nShe was on leave during last year’s protests, but this time she was available, and she decided to get a taste of the action.\nColleagues from other media houses were worried about her, with some questioning why a small girl like her was allowed to come to such a volatile situation.\n“That didn’t deter me,” she says. “Instead, it challenged me that in a such a male-dominated setting, I could still thrive.”\nIt was quite intimidating, however, especially when protesters and goons took over the streets.\n“At first, I had so much anxiety, I could not click any pictures,” she recalls.\nShe had trouble manoeuvring around the chaos while still taking photos.While photojournalists crave exclusives, the environment called for safety to be prioritised.\n“We had to stick together as a team to avoid being attacked at any point,” Mukangai says.\nFellow photographers would even call to check if she was okay, and that eased her nerves.\nShe did not expect her pictures to be published in the paper. When some made the cut, she felt so proud.\n“It’s like a pat on the back,” she says. “This has really motivated me to always try and be part of the few journalists covering the protests.”\nBEATEN BY POLICE\nEnos Teche is used to seeing opposition leaders, activists and unionists lead protests. Not leaderless, party-less and ethnically diverse youths.\nHe watched last year as they fundraised online, printed ‘Reject the Finance Bill’ T-shirts and held signs written ‘Zakayo, shuka (tax collector, come down)’.\n“Clearly, Gen Zs had decided to break their silence after long being inactive in politics,” Teche says.\nRuto’s allies derided the movement as a bunch of cool kids out for adventure, only to end up fleeing Parliament through an underground tunnel when the youths raided the premises.\nThough they fell short of making Ruto ‘Anguka nayo (go with the Finance Bill)’, they shook him into withdrawing the legislation.\nThis year was nothing similar to that, Teche says. Pillaging overshadowed protests.\nTeche has been in photojournalism for 13 years. When not covering general news, sports or business, he’s suiting up for parliamentary press or scouting for off-beat photos.\n“A photographer is as good as his last assignment,” he says.\nHe studied mass communication and journalism. He wanted to do broadcast but loved print, so he freelanced for Nation, Standard, Star and Sunday Express. Many pitches went unpublished, but he took encouragement from the few that were.\nHe joined the Star as an intern in 2014, and has since become a star in his own right. “I have won multiple photojournalism awards,” he says.\nUnfazed by prior undertakings, maandamano presents a dilemma to him. In trainings, he is advised to position himself with the cops, but he has learned the hard way not to trust them.\nSo he drifts to the protesters even though it cost him last year, whenhe lost a lens and a camera to a water cannon.\n“I have been beaten by police while covering political protests before,” he says, citing an assault after opposition leader Raila Odinga swore himself in in 2017.\n“That one took me long to forget, especially when the same officers who beat me asked me to report them to Central police station.”\nTeche loves it when his photos are used prominently and go viral. But he is equally happy just to give a voice to the voiceless.\n“I once photographed a woman outside Jogoo House, protesting over Mugo Wairimu, a fake doctor in Githurai who was drugging and raping his patients,” he says. The quack was later convicted.\n“An activist inboxed me on Facebook, saying, ‘Thank you for showing that.’ Such feedback really motivates me.”\nCOPING WITH TRAUMAAfter a gruelling day covering protests, Okiddy showers thoroughly and replenishes his energy with a proper meal.\n“I try as much as possible to be in a safe environment and get some peace of mind,” he says.\nMukangai unwinds by reaching out to close friends and sharing her ordeal. This gives her relief and helps her calm down.\n“My parents were against it when I first told them I would like to cover the protests,” she says.\n“But later on, they came to terms with it, and now they support me fully.”\nTeche says photographers and videographers are haunted by the moving images they work so tirelessly to bring to audiences.\nHe advocates therapy and medication, noting they can be costly but “we are humans first before being journalists”.\nPrivate sector players say maandamano costs the economy Sh3 billion a day in foregone sales and looting.\nDesperate to avoid more rampage, President Ruto has resorted to terror charges against protesters.\nHe’s also ordered police, whom rights groups say have killed 115 people in a year, to just aim lower next time: “Shoot them in the legs.”\nOkiddy, Mukangai and Teche are on standby. It may not be pretty, but the story must be told.\nTom Jalio is the features editor of the Star and the producer of theJalio TalesYouTube channel",

    "content": "Looking back at the history of the Star, I feel, to paraphrase Paul Simon’s lyric, “Eighteen years come and gone so fast, I might as well have been dreaming. Sunny days have burned a path, across another season.” And my goodness, what a dream it has been!\nI can scarcely believe it has been 18 years since we were pacing the metaphorical delivery room floor, nervously awaiting the birth of the then Nairobi Star. She arrived, full of colour, noise and attitude, onJuly 1, 2007, courtesy of the ever-adventurous Radio Africa Group under the visionary Patrick Quarcoo, or PQ, as we called him.\nThey were already well known for giving Kenyan youth their soundtrack through Kiss FM and Classic 105. Now, they wanted to add a newspaper to the mix, an audacious tabloid that could shout just as loudly as their DJs.\nFrom day one, the Nairobi Star was not here to be polite. It landed with all the subtlety of a matatu horn, bringing with it a 32-page, full-colour tabloid packed to the rafters with sensational human interest stories, flashy headlines, showbiz gossip, fashion, sports and just the right dash of scandal.\nIts tagline was ‘Real-life stories every day,’ which sounded a bit like a soap opera, but that was rather the point.\nThe inaugural front page made jaws drop around the capital, featuring a confession from an assistant minister about arranging abortions for Catholic nuns. As you can imagine, this caused more than a few choking incidents over breakfast.\nThe Star was brash, cheeky and completely unbothered by the conventions of its older, more stately siblings, the Daily Nation and the Standard, who until then had reigned supreme with their careful headlines and restrained prose.\nI had the distinct honour, and mild panic, of being recruited as news editor during the early build-up to launch. ByMay 2007, I was in the trenches alongside a formidable founding editorial team: editor Catherine Gicheru, features editor Judy Munyinyi, sports guru Sulubu Tuva, production editor Joseph Olweny and a host of other brave souls ready to risk professional reputation and sanity in equal measure.\nFor two months, we worked on dry-runs, 32-page A3 test editions that no one outside the newsroom would ever see. The pressure was immense. Not only were we creating something entirely new, but we also had to meet a rigid 5pm layout cut-off imposed by the Nation Media Group’s printers.\nMiss that, and your paper would be bumped to the back of the queue. So yes, punctuality was non-negotiable, caffeine was compulsory and sleep became a rumour.\nOddly enough, one of our very first major stories was about a series of literal tremors, earthquakes, no less, emanating from Tanzania but rattling Nairobi. In hindsight, it was fitting. Because the arrival of the Nairobi Star was itself a seismic event in Kenya’s media landscape.\nMuch like an earth tremor shakes the ground beneath well-established buildings, the Star sent ripples through the carefully ordered world of Kenyan journalism. With its punchy headlines and unashamedly urban flavour, it gave voice to the people and issues often glossed over by the mainstream press. It was raw, intimate and occasionally outrageous.\nWhere the traditional dailies preferred polished and predictable, the Star dived into the messy, emotional realities of life, sex, crime, politics, betrayal, celebrity meltdowns, family drama and the occasional goat theft. Our lean budget and scrappy team did not stop us from having a disproportionately loud impact.\nThe Star had also opened up a new fault line for talent. We brought in a new wave of journalists who were hungry, bold and perhaps just a bit mad. I remain proud to have stood among them, sleeves rolled up and headline font at the ready.\nBy 2009, the paper had grown into its national identity, dropping ‘Nairobi’ from its name and leaning more into politics, while retaining its tabloid soul.Today, the Star is a fixture in Kenya’s media constellation, and its legacy, love it or loathe it, is undeniable.\nThe birth of the Nairobi Star was not just another newspaper launch. It was a proper media tremor, one that cracked old assumptions, shifted the ground under newsrooms and made a whole new generation of readers sit up and pay attention.\nBelieve me, you can still feel the aftershocks.",

One order will promote the international export of US-developed AI technologies, while another aims to root out what the administration describes as \"woke\" or ideologically biased AI systems.\n\"American development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas,\" the White House said. \"With the right government policies, the United States can solidify its position as the leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.\"\nCrypto czar Sacks added that the plan is partially focused on preventing AI technology from being \"misused or stolen by malicious actors\" and will \"monitor for emerging and unforeseen risks from AI\".\nThe Trump administration has positioned the expansion of AI infrastructure and investments in the United States as a way to stay ahead of China.\n\"AI is a revolutionary technology that's going to have profound ramifications for both the economy and national security,\" Sacks said. \"It's just very important that America continues to be the dominant power in AI.\"\nBut critics argued that the plan was a giveaway to Big Tech.\n\"The White House AI Action plan was written by and for tech billionaires, and will not serve the interests of the broader public,\" said Sarah Myers West, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute.\n\"[T]he administration's stance prioritizes corporate interests over the needs of everyday people who are all already being affected by AI,\" West added.\nIn 2023, Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, signed an executive order that called for safety and security standards governing the use of AI in the federal government - an order that was rescinded by Trump on the first day he took office in January.\nDays later, Trump signed an executive order that called for an accelerated AI development, the removal of ideological bias and today's AI action plan, for which it sought public comment.\nOfficials say the plan unveiled Wednesday was shaped by more than 10,000 public comments.\nA former Biden administration official told the BBC that Trump's plan abandoned safeguards that helped protect American national security and public trust.\n\"Accelerating innovation is essential, but dismantling responsible guardrails risks turning America's AI revolution into a reckless gamble,\" said Jim Secreto, former Deputy Chief of Staff to Biden's Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\"Promoting aggressive AI exports without reasonable controls strengthens China's hand,\" Secreto added.\nLast month, TrumpallowedUS technology giant Nvidia to resume sales of its high-end artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, reversing his administration's prior ban on sales of Nvidia's H20 chips to Beijing.\nAI regulation was also a major sticking point in recent negotiations about Trump's massive budget bill passed by Congress earlier this month.\nThe bill originally included a ten-year moratorium barring states from regulating artificial intelligence.\nLawmakers ultimately stripped that language from the bill.",

    "content": "Parenting in Africa / PIXABAYLast week, while I had the realisation of how our kids already think we are old and uncool, this week, I faced the reality of having actual old parents.\nMy parents are in their seventies and truth be told, they are not in their best shape. I have seen those ‘fit’ 70-year-olds and lively 80-year-olds, but it seems our people are cut from a different cloth. The type of cloth that, once crinkled, refuses to straighten back up no matter how much you iron it.\nI had the honour of living with or growing up around grandparents who lived to ripe old ages, but were they the fittest people of their age group? Definitely not! My great grandmother died when she was more than 100 years old.\nI was about six years old myself. By that time, she had stopped walking and turned blind from old age. My maternal grandmother reached a point where she just gave up. She refused to walk until she was completely unable to. She did not have any health issues, just diabetes. But she had reached a point she believed she was too old to try or bother.\nMy paternal grandfather, however, returned to the land of the living after he had been mauled by the jaws of death. He returned to living a long and healthy life long after the doctors had proclaimed there was no hope for him and that he would not live very long.\nAs a child, seeing all this happening around me, I did not give it much thought, even though I saw the impact it had on my parents or the children of the old people, I didn’t really understand it… until now.\nMy parents are generally healthy and living a relaxed retirement life after working hard most of their lives. But they have given into the indulgence of the old age excuse more than they should. They make excuses about not being as mobile as they ought to be. They would rather sit for extended periods of time than occupy themselves with something physical.\nBut when the doctors’ visits start doubling and the hospital admissions start piling up, you realise just how hard it is to be the child or caregiver of an aged parent. It’s not only hard financially but physically and emotionally as well.\nSeeing your once strong-as-an-ox parent wither away is harder than one might imagine. At this age, we have to balance the role of being a caregiver to an aged parent and the parent of a young child. Constantly in-between the polar opposite sides of life, dealing with all the emotional turmoils that come with it.",

    "content": "Raquel Celina Rodriguez watches her step as she walks across the Vega de Tilopozo in Chile's Atacama salt flats.\nIt's a wetland, known for its groundwater springs, but the plain is now dry and cracked with holes she explains were once pools.\n\"Before, the Vega was all green,\" she says. \"You couldn't see the animals through the grass. Now everything is dry.\" She gestures to some grazing llamas.\nFor generations, her family raised sheep here. As the climate changed, and rain stopped falling, less grass made that much harder.\nBut it worsened when \"they\" started taking the water, she explains.\n\"They\" are lithium companies. Beneath the salt flats of the Atacama Desert lie the world's largest reserves of lithium, a soft, silvery-white metal that is an essential component of the batteries that power electric cars, laptops and solar energy storage.\nAs the world transitions to more renewable energy sources, the demand for it has soared.\nIn 2021, about 95,000 tonnes of lithium was consumed globally - by 2024 it had more than doubled to 205,000 tonnes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nBy 2040 it's predicted to rise to more than 900,000 tonnes.\nMost of the increase will be driven by demand for electric car batteries, the IEA says.\nLocals say environmental costs to them have risen too.\nSo, this soaring demand has raised the question: is the world's race to decarbonise unintentionally stoking another environmental problem?\nChile is the second-largest producer of lithium globally after Australia. In 2023, the government launched a National Lithium Strategy to ramp up production through partly nationalising the industry and encouraging private investment.\nIts finance minister previously said the increase in production could be by up to 70% by 2030, although the mining ministry says no target has been set.\nThis year, a major milestone to that is set to be reached.\nA planned joint enterprise between SQM and Chile's state mining company Codelco has just secured regulatory approval for a quota to extract at least 2.5 million metric tonnes of lithium metal equivalent per year and boost production until 2060.\nChile's government has framed the plans as part of the global fight against climate change and a source of state income.\nMining companies predominantly extract lithium by pumping brine from beneath Chile's salt flats to evaporation pools on the surface.\nThe process extracts vast amounts of water in this already drought-prone region.\nFaviola Gonzalez is a biologist from the local indigenous community working in the Los Flamencos National Reserve, in the middle of the Atacama Desert, home to vast salt flats, marshes and lagoons and some 185 species of birds. She has monitored how the local environment is changing.\n\"The lagoons here are smaller now,\" she says. \"We've seen a decrease in the reproduction of flamingos.\"\nShe said lithium mining impacts microorganisms that birds feed on in these waters, so the whole food chain is affected.\nShe points to a spot where, for the first time in 14 years, flamingo chicks hatched this year. She attributes the \"small reproductive success\" to a slight reduction in water extraction in 2021, but says, \"It's small.\"\n\"Before there were many. Now, only a few.\"\nThe underground water from the Andes, rich in minerals, is \"very old\" and replenishes slowly.\n\"If we are extracting a lot of water and little is entering, there is little to recharge the Salar de Atacama,\" she explains.\nDamage to flora has also been found in some areas. On property in the salt flats, mined by the Chilean company SQM, almost one-third of the native \"algarrobo\" (or carob) trees had started dying as early as 2013 due to the impacts of mining, according to a report published in 2022 by the US-based National Resources Defense Council.\nBut the issue extends beyond Chile too. In a report for the US-based National Resources Defense Council in 2022, James J. A. Blair, an assistant professor at California State Polytechnic University, wrote that lithium mining is \"contributing to conditions of ecological exhaustion\", and \"may decrease freshwater availability for flora and fauna as well as humans\".\nHe did, however, say that it is difficult to find \"definitive\" evidence on this topic.\nEnvironmental damage is of course inevitable when it comes to mining. \"It's hard to imagine any kind of mining that does not have a negative impact,\" says Karen Smith Stegen, a political science professor in Germany, who studies the impacts of lithium mining across the world.\nThe issue is that mining companies can take steps to mitigate that damage. \"What [mining companies] should have done from the very beginning was to involve these communities,\" she says.\nFor example, before pumping lithium from underground, companies could carry out \"social impact assessments\" - reviews which take into account the broad impact their work will have on water, wildlife, and communities.\nFor their part, mining companies now say they are listening. The Chilean firm SQM is one of the main players.\nAt one of their plants in Antofagasta, Valentín Barrera, Deputy Manager of Sustainability at SQM Lithium, says the firm is working closely with communities to \"understand their concerns\" and carrying out environmental impact assessments.\nHe feels strongly that in Chile and globally \"we need more lithium for the energy transition.\"\nHe adds that the firm is piloting new technologies. If successful, the idea is to roll these out in their Salar de Atacama plants.\nThese include both extracting lithium directly from brine, without evaporation pools, and technologies to capture evaporated water and re-inject it into the land.\n\"We are doing several pilots to understand which one works better in order to increase production but reduce at least 50% of the current brine extraction,\" he said.\nHe says the pilot in Antofagasta has recovered \"more than one million cubic metres\" of water. \"Starting in 2031, we are going to start this transition.\"\nBut the locals I spoke to are sceptical. \"We believe the Salar de Atacama is like an experiment,\" Faviola argues.\nShe says it's unknown how the salt flats could \"resist\" this new technology and the reinjection of water and fears they are being used as a \"natural laboratory.\"\nSara Plaza, whose family also raised animals in the same community as Raquel, is anxious about the changes she has seen in her lifetime.\nShe remembers water levels dropping from as early as 2005 but says \"the mining companies never stopped extracting.\"\nSara becomes tearful when she speaks about the future.\n\"The salt flats produce lithium, but one day it will end. Mining will end. And what are the people here going to do? Without water, without agriculture. What are they going to live on?\"\n\"Maybe I won't see it because of my age, but our children, our grandchildren will.\"\nShe believes mining companies have extracted too much water from an ecosystem already struggling from climate change.\n\"It's very painful,\" she adds. \"The companies give the community a little money, but I'd prefer no money.\n\"I'd prefer to live off nature and have water to live.\"\nSergio Cubillos is head of the association for the Peine community, where Sara and Raquel live.\nHe says Peine has been forced to change \"our entire drinking water system, electrical system, water treatment system\" because of water shortages.\n\"There is the issue of climate change, that it doesn't rain anymore, but the main impact has been caused by extractive mining,\" he says.\nHe says since it started in the 1980s, companies have extracted millions of cubic metres of water and brine – hundreds of litres per second.\n\"Decisions are made in Santiago, in the capital, very far from here,\" he adds.\nHe believes that if the President wants to fight climate change, like he said when he ran for office, he needs to involve \"the indigenous people who have existed for millennia in these landscapes.\"\nSergio understands that lithium is very important for transitioning to renewable energy but says his community should not be the \"bargaining chip\" in these developments.\nHis community has secured some economic benefits and oversight with companies but is worried about plans to ramp up production.\nHe says while seeking technologies to reduce the impact on water is welcome that \"can't be done sitting at a desk in Santiago, but rather here in the territory.\"\nChile's government stresses there has been \"ongoing dialogue with indigenous communities\" and they have been consulted over the new Codelco-SQM joint venture's contracts to address concerns around water issues, new technologies and contributions to the communities.\nIt says increasing production capacity will be based on incorporating new technologies to minimise the environmental and social impact and that the high \"value\" of lithium due to its role in the global energy transition could provide \"opportunities\" for the country's economic development.\nSergio though worries about their area being a \"pilot project\" and says if the impact of new technology is negative, \"We will put all our strength into stopping the activity that could end with Peine being forgotten.\"\nThe Salar de Atacama is a case study for a global dilemma. Climate change is causing droughts and weather changes. But one of the world's current solutions is – according to locals – exacerbating this.\nThere is a common argument from people who support lithium mining: that even if it damages the environment, it brings huge benefits via jobs and cash.\nDaniel Jimenez, from lithium consultancy iLiMarkets, in Santiago, takes this argument a step further.\nHe claims that environmental damage has been exaggerated by communities who want a pay-out.\n\"This is about money,\" he argues. \"Companies have poured a lot of money into improving roads, schools – but the claims of communities really go back to the fact they want money.\"\nBut Prof Stegen is unconvinced. \"Mining companies always like to say, 'There are more jobs, you're going to get more money',\" she says.\n\"Well, that's not particularly what a lot of indigenous communities want. It actually can be disruptive if it changes the structure of their own traditional economy [and] it affects their housing costs.\n\"The jobs are not the be all and end all for what these communities want.\"\nIn Chile, those I spoke to didn't talk about wanting more money. Nor are they opposed to measures to tackle climate change. Their main question is why they are paying the price.\n\"I think for the cities maybe lithium is good,\" Raquel says. \"But it also harms us. We don't live the life we used to live here.\"\nFaviola does not think electrifying alone is the solution to climate change.\n\"We all must reduce our emissions,\" she says. \"In developed countries like the US and Europe the energy expenditure of people is much greater than here in South America, among us indigenous people.\"\n\"Who are the electric cars going to be for? Europeans, Americans, not us. Our carbon footprint is much smaller.\"\n\"But it's our water that's being taken. Our sacred birds that are disappearing.\"",

    "content": "Babydoll Archi's Instagram account had 1.4 million followers./SCREENGRAB\nIt took just a few days for Indian Instagram sensation Babydoll Archi to double her following to 1.4 million, thanks to a couple of viral social media moments.\nOne was a video that showed her in a red sari, dancing seductively to Dame Un Grr – a Romanian song. And a photo posted on the platform showed her posing with American adult film star Kendra Lust.\nSuddenly, everyone wanted to know about her—and the name Babydoll Archi trended in Google search and spawned countless memes and fan pages. But there was one issue about to emerge – there was no real woman behind the online sensation.\nThe Instagram account was fake, although the face it used had an uncanny likeness to a real woman - a homemaker in Dibrugarh city in Assam, whom we'll call Sanchi.\nThe truth unravelled after her brother lodged a police complaint. Pratim Bora, Sanchi's ex-boyfriend, was arrested.\nSenior police officer Sizal Agarwal who's heading the investigation, told the BBC that Sanchi and Bora had a falling out and the AI likeness he created was to exact \"pure revenge\" on her.\nBora - a mechanical engineer and a self-taught artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast - used private photos of Sanchi to create a fake profile, Ms Agarwal said.\nBora is in custody and has not made any statements yet. The BBC has reached out to his family and will update the article when they speak.\nBabydoll Archi was created in 2020 and the first uploads were made in May 2021. The initial photos were her real pictures that had been morphed, Ms Agarwal said.\n\"As time passed, Bora used tools such as ChatGPT and Dzine to create an AI version. He then populated the handle with deepfake photos and videos.\"\nThe account started picking up likes from last year but it started gaining traction from April this year, she added.\nSanchi is not on social media and she found out about the account only once the mainstream media began profiling Babydoll Archi, describing her as \"an influencer\".\nReports speculated that she could be joining the US porn industry - possibly a first for someone from the north-eastern state of Assam.\nThe short two-paragraph complaint to the police submitted by Sanchi's family on the night of 11 July came with printouts of some photos and videos as evidence.\nMs Agarwal says it did not name anyone because they had no idea who could be behind it.\nBabydoll Archi was not an unfamiliar name for the police. Ms Agarwal says they had also seen media reports and comments speculating that she was AI generated, but there had been no suggestion that it was based on a real person.\nOnce they received the complaint, police wrote to Instagram asking for the details of the account's creator.\n\"Once we received information from Instagram, we asked Sanchi if she knew any Pratim Bora. Once she confirmed, we traced his address in the neighbouring district of Tinsukia. We arrested him on the evening of 12 July.\"\nMs Agarwal says the police have \"seized his laptop, mobile phones and hard drives and his bank documents since he had monetised the account\".\n\"The account had 3,000 subscriptions on linktree and we believe he had earned 1m rupees from it. We believe he made 300,000 rupees in just five days before his arrest,\" she added.\nMs Agarwal says Sanchi is \"extremely distraught - but now she and her family are receiving counselling and they are doing better\".\nThere really is no way to prevent something like this from happening, \"but had we acted earlier, we could have prevented it from gaining so much traction\", Ms Agarwal said.\n\"But Sanchi had no idea because she has no social media presence. Her family too had been blocked out from this account. They became aware only once it went viral,\" she added.\nMeta has not responded to the BBC queries on the case, but it generally does not allow posting of nudity or sexual content. And last month, CBS reported that it removed a number of ads promoting AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people.\nThe Instagram account of Babydoll Archi, which had 282 posts, is no longer available to public - although social media is replete with her photos and videos and one Instagram account seems to have all of them. The BBC has asked Meta what they are planning to do about it.\nMeghna Bal, AI expert and lawyer, says what happened to Sanchi \"is horrible but almost impossible to prevent\".\nShe can go to the court and seek the right to be forgotten, and a court can order the press reports that named her to be taken down but it's hard to scrub all the trace from the internet.\nWhat happened to Sanchi, she says, is what's always been happening to women, where their photos and videos are circulated as revenge.\n\"It's now a lot easier to do because of AI, but such incidents are still not as common as we expect - or they could be under-reported because of stigma or people being targeted may not even know about it as in the present case,\" Ms Bal says.\nAnd people watching it had no incentive to report it to the social media platform or cybercrime portal, she adds.\nIn their complaint against Mr Bora, police have invoked sections of law that deal with sexual harassment, distribution of obscene material, defamation, forgery to harm reputation, cheating by personification and cybercrime. If found guilty, Mr Bora could get up to 10 years in prison.\nThe case which has also led to outrage on social media in recent days has seen some seeking tougher laws to deal with such cases.\nMs Bal believes there are enough laws to take care of such cases, but whether there's scope for new laws to deal with generative AI companies has to be looked at.\n\"But we also have to remember that deepfakes are not necessarily bad and laws have to be carefully crafted because they can be weaponised to chill free speech.\"",

Using natural fibers like\r\ncotton and wool, and even upcycling materials, aligns crochet with the global\r\nmovement toward sustainable, slow living.\n“Each crochet piece is not just décor; it’s\r\na work of art that honors both craftsmanship and the environment,” she adds.\nFor Josephine Soala, an artisan from\r\nNairobi, crochet is both a passion and a livelihood. She began crocheting at\r\nage 15, learning from her mother, and now runs a small business creating\r\ncustom-made crochet décor and clothing pieces.\n“I make everything from plant hangers to\r\nbed throws and table mats,” Soala says with a smile. “People love how unique\r\nand personal crochet items feel in their homes.”\nSoala’s pieces incorporate bold colors and\r\npatterns, infusing cultural heritage into modern design. “I like blending\r\ntraditional patterns with trendy styles. It keeps reflects my identity, while\r\nappealing to clients who want something fresh and vibrant,” she explains.\nFor her, each item carries a story. “When\r\nsomeone buys my crochet wall hanging, they’re not just getting décor. They’re\r\ngetting my time, and my culture and long-lasting artistic pieces,” she says.\nNick Ochieng’, a student in Narok expresses\r\nhis love for the vast world of crochet items.\n“Honestly, I just love crochet. The\r\ntextures, the patterns, the uniqueness — a form of art that is overlooked but\r\nis exquisite.”\nNick says his interest sparked\r\nunexpectedly.\n“About three years ago, I stumbled on a\r\npop-up store in Narok selling crochet wall hangings and plant holders. I was\r\ninstantly hooked, no pun intended. The patterns and  realism caught my eye.''\nSince then, he’s steadily grown a small\r\ncollection: cushion covers, a set of placemats, and even a crocheted lampshade.\nNick likes mixing crochet with other\r\nmaterials like wood or metal.\n“People assume that crochet only uses yarn\r\nto make exquisite pieces, but other materials like wood, metal, or ceramic can be\r\ninterwoven with yarn to create beautiful pieces.”\nHe enjoys supporting local artisans, too.\n“Many of my pieces come from Kenyan makers.\r\nI like knowing that my purchases empower creatives and keep the craft alive. The\r\npieces reflect their profound affection for crochet and quality craftsmanship,”\r\nOchieng’ says.\nTips for adding crochet to your space\nFor readers curious to try crochet décor, crochet\r\nexpert Wanjiku offers some advice:\n1.Start small. Items like\r\ncoasters, throw pillows, or plant holders are easy introductions.\n2.Mix textures. Crochet pairs\r\nbeautifully with wood, metal, and glass.\n3.Choose colors wisely. Neutrals\r\noffer minimalism; vibrant hues create a bold statement.\n4.Care gently. Hand wash the\r\ncrochet pieces using a gentle detergent and keep them out of direct sunlight to\r\nprevent fading.",

    "content": "In life, health is often the thread that holds everything together. For Jerry, a diligent accountant, this thread had frayed, leaving him ensnared in a web of chronic back pain that significantly restricted his daily activities and diminished the quality of his life.\nThe once-vibrant hues of his existence had dulled, overshadowed by the relentless ache that accompanied him from the moment he awoke until he surrendered to sleep each night.\nThe simple act of reaching for his coffee cup became a daunting challenge, each movement punctuated by a sharp, stabbing pain.\nHis life, once a carefully constructed symphony of routine and accomplishment, had become a discordant cacophony of pain and limitation.\nThe evenings he spent with his family, once filled with laughter and shared meals, were now marred by quiet suffering.\nHis hobbies, such as hiking, gardening and even simply playing with his children, became distant memories, replaced by a monotonous cycle of pain medication.\nAn accountant, Jerry’s profession demanded long hours hunched over a computer, his back contorted in unnatural angles as he navigated through spreadsheets.\nThis sedentary lifestyle, compounded by poor posture, had become a breeding ground for the debilitating pain that now defined his existence.\nEach morning, he would rise with a familiar stiffness that transformed simple tasks, such as bending to tie his shoes, lifting a briefcase or twisting to reach for a cup, into Herculean tasks.\nTURNING POINT\nHe confided in Mercy, his wife, whose concern deepened with each passing day. \"The pain and stiffness are interfering with my sleep,” he said, “leading to fatigue and reduced daytime function. I end up dozing off at work at times.\"\nFamily gatherings became a source of anxiety rather than celebration, as Jerry feared an unexpected flare-up would betray him in public.\n\"I have a challenge performing work tasks, and I'm afraid this is leading to reduced productivity or job changes. I risk being sacked if the situation continues,\" he lamented, his voice tinged with frustration and despair.\nOne fateful weekend, seeking respite from the confines of his office, he attempted to clean his compound.\nThe weekend air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and impending rain. A welcome respite from the sterile, fluorescent-lit world of Jerry's office,this Saturdaypromised peace. Or so he thought.\nHis plan: a thorough spring cleaning of his compound. Armed with shears, a rusty wheelbarrow and a stubborn resolve, Jerry attacked the overgrown fence, snipping away at the unruly vines with a satisfying snip, snip.\nThe shears, however, were no match for the stubborn growth. Each cut felt like a battle won only to be followed by another.\nHe finally conquered the fence, a small victory in his day of domestic warfare. Next, the garbage. A mountain of refuse filled the wheelbarrow to overflowing, containing discarded newspapers, plastic bottles and the remnants of a forgotten barbecue.\nWith a grunt, Jerry heaved the unwieldy contraption, ready to transport his unwanted treasures to their fiery demise.\nThen, a searing pain shot through his lower back, a sudden, sharp stab that stole the breath from his lungs. His carefully planned weekend had imploded in a symphony of pain and scattered rubbish.\n“Ooouch!” he screamed, the sound echoing in the sudden stillness. The wheelbarrow, freed from his grasp, tipped precariously, its contents scattering across the compound like a macabre confetti.\nThe idyllic scene had transformed into a chaotic mess, mirroring the turmoil in his suddenly aching back.\nMercy rushed to his side, panic evident in her eyes. She helped him lie down and administered a gentle massage.\nBut moments later, the pain resurfaced, a stubborn reminder of his fragile state. It was clear to both of them that the time had come for Jerry to seek professional help.\n\"You should consider consulting a doctor if your back pain is severe, persistent or interfering with your daily life. Seek medical advice,\" Mercy urged.\nMEDICAL ADVICE\nJerry, motivated by his wife’s encouragement and the realisation that self-care measures had failed him, finally made the decision to consult a doctor.\nAt the hospital, Jerry met Dr Mavuno, an esteemed orthopaedist renowned for his expertise in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal disorders.\nWith a warm demeanour and an air of confidence, Dr Mavuno listened intently as Jerry recounted his struggles.\nDr Mavuno outlined a comprehensive approach to managing Jerry's condition, emphasising a combination of lifestyle modifications, physical therapy and home remedies.\nAs Jerry left the consultation feeling hopeful yet apprehensive, he began to implement the changes suggested by Dr Mavuno.\nHowever, after a few days, he returned to the hospital, his frustration palpable. While the pain relievers had offered temporary relief, the chronic aches persisted, a constant reminder of his limitations.\nMoved by the agony etched across Jerry's face, Dr Mavuno devised a plan to strengthen Jerry's core and back muscles.\nEncouraging Jerry to embrace physical fitness, he referred him to Bodylicious Gym, owned by the enthusiastic fitness trainer Baba Kajojo.\nUnder Kajojo's guidance, Jerry embarked on a transformative journey that would not only alleviate his back pain but also reignite the joy in his life.\nDays turned into weeks and weeks into months. Jerry began to notice a marked improvement in his condition. The once-unbearable pain began to recede, allowing him to reclaim the activities he had long abandoned.\nThe emotional weight that had burdened him for so long began to lift, replaced by a newfound sense of purpose and vitality.",

    "content": "George had always\r\nbeen a man of indulgence, relishing the pleasures of life with little regard\r\nfor the consequences.\nHe had a reputation\r\namong his friends for having a voracious appetite, especially for roasted meat,\r\nbeer and cigarettes, which he gobbled up with ravenous abandon.\nYet, the very\r\npleasure that had defined his existence was now the source of his torment. A\r\nsharp pain had pierced through his left leg, a harbinger of the condition that\r\nwould change his life forever: gout.\nThe agony that\r\nfollowed was unbearable, prompting George to confront the reality of his health\r\nand seek a solution. Pain, often regarded as a mere physical sensation, can\r\nserve as a profound catalyst for change.\nFor George, a man\r\nwhose life had been punctuated by the sharp, debilitating pangs of gout, this\r\npainful experience became the impetus for a transformative journey.\nIn the throes of\r\nagony, George found himself at a crossroads, compelled to confront not only his\r\nhealth but also his lifestyle choices.\nThe day began like\r\nany other until a sudden, excruciating pain pierced through his left leg.\r\nWrithing in agony, he clutched the bed beside him, grappling with the\r\nrealisation that this was not a fleeting discomfort but a manifestation of a\r\ndeeper issue.\nHe grabbed the seat\r\nnext to him and pulled himself off the bed, writhing in agony. Gout, a\r\ncondition marked by excessive uric acid in the blood, had taken hold of his\r\nlife, transforming his joints into battlegrounds for crystalline formations\r\nthat inflicted unbearable pain.\nAs he lay there, a\r\nprofound thought emerged: he could no longer endure such suffering. The time\r\nhad come to seek a long-term solution.\nWith determination\r\netched on his face, George made his way to the hospital that morning. The\r\nsterile environment of the clinic was a stark contrast to the chaos within\r\nhim.\nDr Ayana, a seasoned\r\nphysician, greeted him with a calm demeanour that belied the urgency of his\r\ncondition. As she explained the complexities of gout, George listened intently.\n\"It can occasionally\r\nrun in families,\" the physician said.\nThis disease is more\r\nprevalent in men, particularly as they age. Being overweight, drinking alcohol,\r\ntaking diuretics (water tablets) or taking medications for high blood pressure\r\nmay increase your risk of developing gout.\n\"It may also\r\nattack people who have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, kidney problems,\r\nosteoarthritis or diabetes, or have had surgery or an injury,\" Dr Ayana\r\nsaid.\n\"You may\r\nexperience a gout attack if you suffer from a feverish illness, consume\r\nexcessive amounts of alcohol or food, become dehydrated, hurt a joint or take\r\ncertain medications. If you feel an attack beginning, always make sure to get\r\ntreatment right away.\"\nPREVENTION OVER CURE\n\"Doctor, what\r\ncan I do to keep gout from returning?\" George asked, his face etched with\r\nanxiety.\n\"Changing to a\r\nhealthier lifestyle may help you avoid or reduce gout attacks in future. Try to\r\nreduce your weight if you are overweight, but stay away from crash diets,” the\r\ndoctor said.\n“Consume a nutritious\r\ndiet as directed by your physician. Try to limit your weekly alcohol\r\nconsumption to no more than 14 units by designating certain days as\r\nalcohol-free.\n\"You can stay\r\nhydrated by drinking a lot of fluids. Engage in regular exercise, but refrain\r\nfrom strenuous activities or straining your joints. Make an effort to stop\r\nsmoking and consult a doctor about vitamin C supplements.\"\nOn that fateful\r\nmorning, as George writhed in pain, a realisation dawned upon him. He could no\r\nlonger afford to ignore the signals his body was sending. The decision to visit\r\nDr Ayana was not merely a choice; it was a desperate plea for help.\nThe doctor's words\r\nstruck a deep chord with him as hesat in\r\nthe sterile examination room.\nEach word resonated\r\nwith him, illuminating the lifestyle choices he had made that had led him to\r\nthis moment.\nDr Ayana’s advice was\r\nclear: adopting healthier habits could mitigate future gout attacks. The\r\nprospect of change loomed before him, daunting yet necessary. George felt a\r\nflicker of hope igniting within him, but the road ahead seemed fraught with\r\nchallenges.\nThe notion of eating\r\naccording to the doctor’s advice struck George profoundly. He envisioned\r\nhimself at a dining table adorned with vibrant greens, a stark contrast to his\r\nprevious feasts of roasted meat.\nThe idea of\r\nrelinquishing his beloved culinary indulgences felt insurmountable. Yet, as Dr\r\nAyana continued to elaborate on the importance of hydration, exercise and\r\nmoderation, George's mind began to shift. He recalled the gym he had passed on\r\nhis way home, a beacon of possibility amidst his despair.\nThe following day,\r\npropelled by a newfound determination, George ventured to the Baba Kajojo\r\nFitness Centre. As he stepped through the doors, he was greeted by the imposing\r\nfigure of Baba Kajojo himself, a man whose presence exuded strength and\r\nvitality.\n\"Greetings, I am\r\nthe owner of the gym. Are you up for the adventure of our fitness empire?” Baba\r\nKajojo asked.\nGeorge returned the\r\nsmile, reached for Baba Kajojo's hand, took it and gave it a firm shake.\n\"Indeed. I want\r\nto take part in the amazing and life-changing experience,\" George\r\nremarked.\nTheir handshake was\r\nmore than a mere greeting; it was a pact forged in the spirit of\r\ntransformation.\nThe days turned into\r\nweeks as George immersed himself in the world of fitness. He discovered the joy\r\nof movement, the exhilaration of sweating out his frustrations and the\r\ncamaraderie of fellow gym-goers who shared similar aspirations.\nGradually, he began\r\nto notice the subtle yet significant changes in his body and mind. His cravings\r\nfor alcohol diminished, and the urge to smoke faded into oblivion. The gym\r\nbecame a sanctuary where he could channel his pain into strength.\nMonths later, George\r\nfound himself back in Dr Ayana’s office, a mix of anticipation and trepidation\r\ncoursing through him. As he entered, the doctor’s expression shifted from\r\nprofessional concern to genuine surprise.\nThe man before her\r\nwas transformed; he exuded health and vitality. George recounted his journey,\r\ndetailing the lifestyle changes he had embraced and the pain that had\r\ndissipated.\nDr Ayana's approval\r\nwas palpable. \"You have done remarkably well, George,\" she said, her\r\nvoice filled with encouragement. \"You risked losing a leg.\"\nThe relief washed\r\nover him like a cool breeze on a sweltering day.

    "content": "In the quiet town of\r\nPewa Pewa, life ambled along at a leisurely pace, punctuated by the rhythmic\r\nclinking of glasses at the local pub and the soft hiss of smoke escaping from\r\nthe lips of drunken revellers.\nAmong them was Sam, a\r\nman of routine, a creature of habit whose daily rituals revolved around the\r\ncomforting embrace of nicotine and alcohol.\nHe smoked like a\r\nchimney, the acrid scent of tobacco clinging to him like a second skin. Each\r\npuff was a momentary escape, an illusion of control in a chaotic world.\nHe drank like a fish,\r\nthe clinking of glasses a soundtrack to his life, drowning out the whispers of\r\nconcern from those around him.\nYet, beneath the surface\r\nof his joviality and easygoing demeanour lay a growing storm, one that would\r\nsoon threaten not only his life but the very fabric of his family.\nSam's lifestyle was a\r\nsource of concern for many, particularly his physician, Dr Mamboleo, who begged\r\nhim to change his ways.\n“You’re playing with\r\nfire, Sam. You need to cut down on smoking and drinking. Your body can only\r\ntake so much,” Mamboleo would say.\nBut Sam, wrapped in the\r\ncomforting embrace of his vices, dismissed the warnings with a chuckle. He\r\nrefused to budge and disdained the doctor's earnest counsel.\n“I’m fine, Doc! Just\r\nliving life to the fullest!” he would retort, a cigarette dangling from his\r\nlips like a badge of honour.\nAs the months slipped\r\nby, Sam’s weight increased rapidly. He brushed aside the growing numbers on the\r\nscale, the dyspnea (shortness of breath) that accompanied even the most basic\r\nof chores, and the nagging exhaustion that hung over his days. The simple act\r\nof climbing the stairs left him gasping for air.\nThe once sprightly man\r\nbecame a shadow of his former self, his energy waning as health issues began to\r\ncreep into his life.\nYet, Sam remained\r\nresolute in his denial, attributing these symptoms to age rather than the\r\nconsequences of his choices. In his mind, he was invincible, immune to the\r\nrepercussions of his choices.\nBut life has a way of\r\ndelivering harsh lessons, often when least expected. One fateful afternoon, the\r\nreality of his situation struck like a bolt of lightning.\nSam was sitting in his\r\nliving room, a glass of whiskey in one hand and a cigarette in the other, when\r\na sudden wave of dizziness washed over him.\nHe awoke in a haze, a\r\nsense of unease gnawing at him. As he attempted to rise from his seat, a wave\r\nof dizziness washed over him and he stumbled, his vision blurring.\nPanic set in as he\r\ngrasped the edge of the table for support, realising that something was\r\nterribly wrong. The world spun, colours blurred and a sharp pain shot through\r\nhis head. Panic surged through him as his vision narrowed, and he felt himself\r\nslipping away.\nHis wife, Clara, entered\r\nthe room just in time to witness the harrowing scene. The sight of her husband,\r\nonce a pillar of strength, now crumpled on the floor, was a nightmare come to\r\nlife.\nIn a state of panic and\r\nshock, she rushed to his side, her heart racing as she tried to rouse him.\r\n“Sam! Sam!” she cried, her voice trembling with fear.\nNeighbours, alerted by\r\nher frantic screams, flocked into their home, a mix of concern and confusion\r\netched on their faces.\nAmid the chaos, Clara’s\r\ninstincts kicked in. She called for help, her voice steady despite the turmoil\r\nwithin. The ambulance was a ray of hope when it finally arrived.\nParamedics rushed in,\r\nswiftly assessing Sam’s condition and administering first aid. Clara watched\r\nhelplessly as they worked, her heart heavy with dread.\nThe sirens wailed as Sam\r\nwas whisked away. The hospital became Sam’s new reality for the next month. The\r\nsterile smell of antiseptic replaced the familiar scent of whiskey and smoke,\r\nand the constant beeping of machines served as a grim reminder of the fragility\r\nof life.\nThe diagnosis was\r\nsobering: he had narrowly escaped a stroke, a wake-up call that reverberated\r\nthrough his very being.\nAs the days turned into\r\nweeks, the gravity of his situation began to sink in. The financial burden of\r\nhis medical care was staggering. Bills piled up like the ashtrays that once\r\ncluttered his home, a stark reminder of the cost of his former lifestyle. The\r\nenormity of the expenses served as a catalyst for change, igniting a flicker of\r\nresolve within him.\nClara visited daily, her\r\neyes reflecting a mixture of love and disappointment.\n“You scared me, Sam,”\r\nshe would say softly, her voice laced with unspoken fears. “I don’t want to\r\nlose you.”\nA flash of insight came\r\nto Sam one day as he lay on the hospital bed, staring at the ceiling. The\r\nthought of leaving Clara and their children without a husband and father struck\r\nhim with a profound sense of dread.\nUpon his release from\r\nhospital, Sam emerged with a profound commitment to change. The experience had\r\nshaken him to the core, igniting a desire to reclaim his health and\r\nwell-being.\nHe pored over books and\r\narticles that illuminated the path to a healthier lifestyle. He sought help\r\nfrom professionals, attending support groups and counselling sessions.\nGradually, he began to\r\nreplace the cigarette in his hand with a bottle of water, the whiskey glass\r\nwith a plate of fresh fruits and vegetables.\nSam embraced a healthier\r\ndiet, one rich in nutrients and vitality. Gone were the processed snacks and\r\nsugary beverages that once filled his shelves. In their place stood fresh\r\nproduce, lean proteins and whole grains, each ingredient a building block for\r\nhis newfound vitality.\nHe discovered the joys\r\nof cooking, experimenting with new recipes that delighted his palate and\r\nnourished his body. Exercise became the cornerstone of Sam’s new\r\nlifestyle.\nWith Clara by his side,\r\nthey explored the beauty of nature, hiking trails and cycling through the\r\npicturesque landscapes of Pewa Pewa.\nHe became more present,\r\nmore engaged with his family and friends. The laughter that once echoed in the\r\npub was now shared over family dinners, where stories were exchanged and bonds\r\nstrengthened.\nAs the seasons changed,\r\nso did Sam. The man who once smoked like a chimney and drank like a fish had\r\nbecome a beacon of health and vitality.",

    "content": "Felix stood in the\r\ngolden glow of the late afternoonsun,\r\nhis heart racing with a mix of excitement and trepidation.\nThe soft breeze, thick\r\nwith the sweet scent of blooming jasmine, hummed with the promise of a perfect\r\nmoment.\nHe had a plan, a\r\nwhimsical idea that he believed would sweep his girlfriend Essie off her feet.\r\nWith a mischievous grin, he approached her, gently wrapping his arms around her\r\nwaist.\n“Ready?” he asked, his\r\nvoice laced with anticipation.\nEssie laughed, her eyes\r\nsparkling with affection and a hint of skepticism. “What are you planning,\r\nFelix?”\nWith a determined glint\r\nin his eye, Felix attempted to lift her into the air, envisioning a romantic\r\nwhirl of love, where they would spin together, lost in a moment of joy.\nHowever, as he strained\r\nagainst the weight of her laughter and the reality of gravity, he quickly\r\nrealised that his romantic aspirations were met with an unyielding\r\nobstacle.\n“Come on, just a little\r\nhigher!” he urged, but as he struggled, it became painfully clear that his\r\nattempt was futile. Essie was heavier than he had anticipated, and despite his\r\nbest efforts, he could barely budge her. The initial thrill of the moment began\r\nto wane, replaced by a growing sense of embarrassment.\nBut Felix was not one to\r\ngive up easily. With renewed determination, he took a deep breath, bracing\r\nhimself for another attempt.\nThis time, he summoned\r\nall his strength, and with a grunt, he managed to lift her off the ground, if\r\nonly for a fleeting moment. The exhilaration was short-lived, however, as a\r\nsharp pain shot through his back.\nIn a dramatic twist of\r\nfate, the couple’s joyous whirl transformed into a chaotic tumble. With a loud\r\ngroan, they both collapsed, landing unceremoniously in a nearby sewage-filled\r\nditch.\nThe world around them\r\nseemed to pause for a moment, a collective gasp of disbelief echoing from the\r\nsmall crowd of inquisitive bystanders that had gathered. Some were grinning,\r\nothers laughing, and a few expressing genuine sympathy for the couple’s\r\nunfortunate predicament.\nAmong the curious\r\nonlookers was Baba Kajojo, Felix’s friend and neighbour. He had been strolling\r\npast when the commotion caught his attention. As he approached, his eyes widened\r\nin shock at the sight of Felix and Essie, drenched in the murky waters of the\r\nditch.\n“Felix! What happened?”\r\nBaba exclaimed, rushing forward.\nEssie, still reeling\r\nfrom the shock, managed to grab Baba’s hand as he extended it toward her. With\r\na firm pull, he helped her out of the ditch, and soon after, Felix followed\r\nsuit, both of them dripping with embarrassment and sewage.\n“Thanks, Baba,” Felix\r\nmuttered, his face flushed with shame.\nAfter a hasty clean-up\r\nat a nearby hotel, where they scrubbed away the remnants of their misadventure,\r\nthe couple returned home, their spirits dampened but not extinguished.\nThe bystanders’ laughter\r\nechoed in their minds, a reminder of their momentary folly.\nLater that evening, as\r\nthey sat on the couch,\r\nstill processing the day’s events, Baba Kajojo paid them a visit. With a\r\nfriendly grin, he plopped down beside them, eager to lighten the mood.\n“You know, Felix,” he\r\nbegan, “maybe you should think about practising at a gym. It might help with…\r\nlifting your girlfriend.”\nFelix chuckled, a mix of\r\namusement and reluctance washing over him. “A gym? Really? I don’t know, Baba.\r\nI’m not exactly the fitness type.”\n“Come on,” Baba urged,\r\nhis enthusiasm infectious. “It could be fun! Plus, imagine how impressed Essie\r\nwill be when you can lift her with ease!”\nFelix hesitated, the\r\nidea swirling in his mind. The thought of sweating it out in a gym, surrounded\r\nby weights and machines, was daunting. But as he glanced at Essie, her eyes\r\nfilled with encouragement and a hint of mischief, he felt a spark of motivation\r\nignite within him.\n“Alright, I’ll give it a\r\nshot,” he finally relented, a smile breaking through his initial\r\nreluctance.\nDays turned into weeks\r\nas Felix embarked on his newfound fitness journey. He joined the local gym,\r\nsurrounded by the clanking of weights and the rhythmic sounds of\r\ndetermination.\nBaba Kajojo became his\r\nworkout buddy, offering encouragement and playful banter that made the sessions\r\nenjoyable. They laughed through the pain, sharing stories and dreams as they\r\npushed each other to new heights.\nSlowly but surely, Felix\r\nbegan to see changes, not just in his physical strength, but in his confidence\r\nas well.\nAs the weeks rolled on,\r\nthe fruits of his labour became evident. He could lift weights he once deemed\r\nimpossible, and, most importantly, he could now lift Essie with ease.\nOne sunny afternoon, as\r\nthey strolled through the park, Felix decided it was time to put his training\r\nto the test. With a playful glint in his eye, he turned to Essie, feigning\r\nnonchalance. “Hey, how about a lift?”\nEssie raised an eyebrow,\r\na smile creeping across her face. “You think you can handle it this time?”\nWith a confident grin,\r\nFelix wrapped his arms around her waist and lifted her effortlessly off the\r\nground. They spun around in a circle, laughter ringing through the air, and for\r\na moment, time stood still. The world faded away, and it was just the two of\r\nthem, lost in their whirl of love.\nAs they stopped, Essie\r\ngazed up at him, her eyes sparkling with admiration. “Wow, Felix! You’ve really\r\nbeen working hard, haven’t you?”\nFelix chuckled, a mix of\r\npride and joy swelling in his chest. “I had to, right? I couldn’t let a little\r\nsewage mishap hold me back!”\nThey both burst into\r\nlaughter, the memory of their fall now a cherished story rather than a source\r\nof embarrassment.",

    "content": "The vibrant hallways of Tengeza Pesa Media Group were\r\nalive with excitement as the year drew to a close.\nThe company, known for its commitment to employee\r\nrecognition, had a cherished tradition: an end-of-year celebration that\r\nhonoured hard work and dedication.\nThis year was no different, and the excitement was\r\npalpable as employees prepared for a night of revelry, music and friendly\r\ncompetition.\nAs thesundipped below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the\r\noffice building, co-workers, united by a shared sense of accomplishment,\r\ngathered in anticipation.\nThe evening unfolded like a well-rehearsed dance,\r\norchestrated by the company's CEO, a master of party planning. The venue was a\r\nkaleidoscope of colour, sparkling lights casting playful shadows on the faces\r\nof the revellers.\nA symphony of scents, including the aroma of\r\ndelectable food, blended with the animated conversation to create a\r\nvibrant atmosphere that guaranteed a night to remember.\nThe DJ, a maestro of sound, lit up the ambience with\r\nan eclectic mix of music that resonated through the hall. Even the most\r\nreserved attendees jammed the dance floor, their bodies swaying to the catchy\r\nbeat.\nBut the dance contest was the night's high point. A\r\ntantalising Sh100,000 cash prize was up for grabs, luring competitors from all\r\nover the organisation.\nAmong them was Elias, Baba Kajojo's pal, known for his\r\nextraordinary talent on the dance floor. His movements were a mesmerising blend\r\nof rhythm and grace.\nAs the night wore on, Elias' magnetic energy drew the\r\ncrowd in, their cheers and applause echoing through the hall. The vibrant\r\nenergy of the celebration, the infectious rhythm of the music and the\r\ncamaraderie of the employees all coalesced into a single, unforgettable\r\nexperience.\nTwenty dancers, each a whirlwind of talent and\r\npassion, had poured their hearts onto the stage. The competition was a\r\ncrucible, a fiery test of skill and spirit. Each pirouette, each leap, was\r\na brushstroke on the canvas of their dreams.\nThe initial heat had whittled the field down to 10,\r\nthen five, each dancer a diamond in the rough, polished by years of dedication.\r\nThe audience, captivated, became a chorus of cheers, their energy fuelling the\r\nspectacle.\nThe judges, their faces impassive masks, scrutinised\r\nevery gesture, every nuance. Unable to settle on an outright victor, they\r\ncalled for a second round.\nThe tension in the air was palpable, a silent scream\r\nechoing through the hall. The music pulsed with a rhythm that thrummed through\r\nElias’s veins. He was a whirlwind of energy, his movements a blur of grace and\r\npower.\n\"Tonight,\r\nI'm going to win. I'm going to claim the Sh100,000 prize,\" Elias told Baba\r\nKajojo.\nBut the night had a cruel twist in store for him. As\r\nthe competition heated up, fatigue, like a creeping shadow, stole his energy,\r\nleaving him gasping for breath. The once-effortless moves became laboured, his\r\nbody protesting with every twist and turn.\nThen, in a moment of reckless ambition, he attempted a\r\nmove he knew was beyond his current strength. A sharp, searing pain ripped\r\nthrough his right leg, a muscle pull that rendered him immobile.\nThe world spun, the music faded and the spotlight\r\nshifted to the remaining dancers as he hobbled off the dance floor, his dreams\r\nof victory shattered. Josto, his rival, emerged victorious. Elias watched, his\r\nheart heavy with the weight of his loss.\nHe sat on the sidelines, a spectator to the joyous spectacle he had been\r\nforced to abandon. The disappointment gnawed at him, a bitter taste on his\r\ntongue.\nBaba Kajojo, a beacon of warmth and wisdom, sat beside him, his eyes filled with concern.\r\n\"You danced brilliantly, Elias,\" he said, his voice a soothing balm.\r\n\"It's just one competition.\"\nBut Elias couldn't shake the feeling of regret. The\r\nwords \"I wish I had been fit enough\" echoed in his mind, a haunting\r\nreminder of his limitations.\nBaba Kajojo, ever the optimist, offered a different\r\nperspective. \"You have the talent, Elias. But you also need to take care\r\nof your body. Have you considered going to the gym?\"\nInitially, Elias hesitated at the thought. The gym\r\nseemed like a daunting commitment, a departure from the carefree joy of\r\ndancing. But with newfound resolve, he began his journey to fitness, immersing\r\nhimself in a rigorous training regimen that complemented his dancing.\nThe initial days were a battle against fatigue and\r\nsoreness, but the memory of that fateful night fuelled his perseverance.\nAs weeks morphed into months, the changes were\r\nundeniable. His stamina, once a fragile thread, grew into a sturdy rope,\r\nallowing him to endure the gruelling routines. With each rep, each lunge, each\r\nleap, his confidence blossomed, a fragile seedling nurtured by the sweat of his\r\nbrow.\nFinally, it was time for another year-end celebration.\r\nMonths had passed since the sting of defeat, but the memory of his faltering\r\nsteps was still fresh in mind.\nElias, his heart pounding with anticipation, stepped\r\nonto the dance floor, ready to face the challenge once more.\nThe music pulsed, a rhythmic heartbeat that resonated\r\nwithin him. The crowd, captivated by his raw energy, became a chorus of cheers,\r\ntheir enthusiasm fuelling his performance.\nThe tension in the room increased at the end of the\r\ncontest as the judges deliberated.\nAnd then, the announcement echoed through the hall, a\r\ntriumphant declaration: \"And the winner is… Elias!\"\nElias stood on stage beaming, the Sh100,000 prize as a\r\nmemento of his triumph.",

    "content": "I have known no peace and\r\nrest in the last month. Since January started, my child has been sick every\r\nweek. As these are winter-related illnesses, the doctors will never give an\r\nappointment for such maladies. One is left to struggle with over-the-counter medications,\r\nhomeopathy, ayurveda or any home remedies one is familiar with.\nWhenever my son is sick, we\r\npull him out of school and he spends a good chunk of the week at home,\r\nrecovering. But as soon we send him back to school, he returns with a snotty\r\nnose in a couple of days. With the freezing temperatures, flu season and germy\r\nkindergarten kids, we can barely hope for a week of nothingness.\nBeing the primary caregiver\r\nmeans that I’m the one who is more susceptible to my child’s viruses. Since I\r\nam also battling my own health issues leading to a low immunity, I have been on\r\na sick cycle since December. I get severe coughs, body aches and suffer from\r\nlethargy every so often. In these moments, like today itself, I want nothing\r\nmore than to return to my role as daughter.\nWhen daughters marry and\r\nbecome mothers, we are often forced to erase our identity as our parents’\r\nchildren as we are too busy caring for others and putting their needs above\r\nours. As a mother, I am still expected to deliver some results even when ill.\r\nThe least amount of effort I can put in on a bad day is at least 60 per cent.\r\nMeanwhile, as a daughter, I have no expectations, I am sick and I can get taken\r\ncare of.\nThose fortunate to still have\r\nparents and a home to return to know this feeling very well. No matter how old\r\nwe get, no matter how old our parents get, the moment we enter home, we become\r\ntheir babies once more.\nNothing says cared for and\r\nloved like a daughter who is sick at home. The spoiling, the constant care, the\r\nexpectation that we cannot do anything except rest is what I would travel\r\nthousands of miles for.\nLiving far from home makes\r\none appreciate even more the life you had before you became a parent. A life\r\nthat is taken away from you in the blink of an eye. A life you may never return\r\nto. As much as I love being a mother and would not change it for the world, I\r\nlived more of my life as a daughter, getting accustomed to certain ways of\r\nlife. Which is why I cannot help the sudden ‘cravings’ of being home when I’m\r\nsick myself.\nIt’s like when they\r\ntell you to put your own mask on the airplane before helping others. One needs\r\nto fill his cup before nurturing others. This is why it shouldn't be frowned on\r\nwhen mothers need a respite. Remember even in our worst time, we are still\r\nworrying and caring for others, which is why when weare down, we should take time off to completely recover.",

Her career at a prestigious media company was\r\nskyrocketing, her bungalow nestled in a lush suburb was a testament to her\r\nsuccess, and her bank account overflowed with the fruits of her labour.\nEmily's life seemed\r\nperfect to the outside world. She was the embodiment of success, often the\r\ncentre of attention at social gatherings, where her charisma and charm\r\ncaptivated everyone around her.\nBut beneath the shiny\r\nexterior, Emily harboured a secret struggle. Years of indulging in junk food\r\nhad taken their toll, leaving her with a body that no longer reflected the\r\nvibrant spirit within.\nShe put on too much\r\nweight and started to feel jealous of her female friends, who seemed to be\r\nendowed with the bodies of models.\nThe girl in the mirror,\r\nonce lithe and carefree, now carried the weight of her insecurities on her\r\nshoulders. The reflection stared back, a stranger in her own skin.\nThe extra pounds, a silent\r\ntestament to her emotional turmoil, felt like a betrayal, a constant reminder\r\nof her perceived flaws.\nShe watched her friends,\r\ntheir bodies sculpted by nature, effortlessly gliding through life. They were\r\nthe models of her dreams, the envy of her heart. Each curve, each line, seemed\r\nto whisper tales of confidence and acceptance, leaving her feeling like a faded\r\nphotograph in a world of vibrant colours.\nThe mirror became a\r\nbattlefield, a place where she waged war against her own reflection. Every glance,\r\na painful reminder of her perceived shortcomings. The whispers of self-doubt\r\nechoed in her mind, a chorus of negativity drowning out her own voice.\nCRASH DIET\nIn her quest for a quick\r\nfix, Emily resorted to drastic measures. Desperate to shed the extra weight,\r\nshe embarked on a crash diet. She began skipping meals and drastically reducing\r\nher caloric intake, believing that this would be her path to reclaiming her\r\nphysique.\nThe results were\r\ndisastrous. The initial thrill of seeing the scale drop was intoxicating, but\r\nit was short-lived. As the days stretched into weeks, Emily came to feel\r\nexhausted.\nHer energy plummeted,\r\nher focus waned, and her once-thriving career began to falter. Her\r\nonce-boundless enthusiasm diminished.\nThe very job that had\r\nonce ignited her passion now felt like an insurmountable challenge, and the\r\nvibrant individual everyone admired began to fade into a shadow of her former\r\nself.\nConcerned about her\r\ndwindling performance, her boss summoned her to the office, seeking an explanation.\n\"Your performance\r\ncurve has shown a significant decline, which is extremely concerning,\" he\r\nsaid.\n“The company intends to\r\nlay off some employees, and I am afraid you will be a target if you do not work\r\nto improve your sales returns.”\nIt was during one of\r\nthese challenging days that Emily confided in Baba Kajojo, a co-worker whose\r\nunwavering dedication to fitness was as evident as his robust physique.\nAs she shared her\r\nstruggles, Emily felt a mixture of vulnerability and hope. Baba listened\r\nintently, his eyes reflecting understanding and concern.\nAfter a moment of\r\ncontemplation, he gently interjected, “Emily, skipping meals is not the\r\nsolution to your weight problems. You need to nourish your body to fuel your\r\nsuccess.”\nHis words struck a chord\r\nwithin her. Emily had been so focused on the number on the scale that she had\r\nneglected the fundamental truth about health: it is not solely about weight but\r\nabout well-being.\nBaba, a fitness\r\nenthusiast with a wealth of knowledge, extended an invitation to join a local\r\ngym, offering to guide her on a journey to reclaim her vitality.\nWith a mix of\r\ntrepidation and excitement, Emily accepted Baba’s invitation. The first day at\r\nthe gym was daunting. The clanking of weights and the rhythmic pounding of feet\r\non treadmills created an atmosphere that was both intimidating and\r\ninvigorating.\nYet, as Emily stepped\r\nonto the treadmill, she felt a flicker of hope. This was a new beginning, a\r\nchance to reclaim not just her body but her energy and zest for life.\nUnder Baba's guidance,\r\nEmily learned that fitness was not merely about losing weight but about\r\nbuilding strength and resilience.\nThey embarked on a\r\njourney that included strength training, cardio and a balanced diet. Baba\r\nintroduced her to wholesome foods, teaching her how to cook nutritious meals\r\nthat were both satisfying and delicious.\nFEEDING WELL\nEmily discovered the joy\r\nof preparing meals filled with vibrant fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and\r\nwhole grains.\nAs weeks turned into\r\nmonths, Emily began to witness a transformation that extended beyond the\r\nphysical. Her body started to change; the scale reflected a gradual loss of\r\nweight, but more importantly, she felt invigorated.\nThe energy that had once\r\neluded her returned, and with it came a renewed sense of purpose. Emily began\r\nto excel in her work, her creativity flourishing as her confidence\r\nsoared.\nThe gym became her\r\nsanctuary, a place where she rediscovered her strength and vitality. She forged\r\nnew friendships and embraced a community of like-minded individuals. The\r\ninitial struggle gave way to a newfound love for movement, and her body began\r\nto transform.\nEach workout was a\r\ntestament to her commitment, a celebration of her progress. She learned to\r\nappreciate her body for what it could do rather than how it looked, a profound\r\nshift in perspective that would guide her for years to come.\nEmily's transformation\r\nwas not just physical; it was a holistic journey that redefined her understanding\r\nof success. She realised that true success encompasses not only professional\r\nachievements but also personal well-being.\nThe vibrant individual\r\nwho once sought validation through material possessions now found fulfilment in\r\nthe strength of her body and the clarity of her mind.\nAs she stood in front of\r\nthe mirror one morning, admiring the reflection of a woman who had embraced her\r\njourney, Emily felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude.\nThe weight melted away,\r\nrevealing the sculpted physique she had always dreamed of.\nShe had not only\r\nachieved the body shape she had long coveted but also discovered a profound\r\nsense of self-worth that transcended the superficial measures of success.\nHer boss called her into\r\nhis office one sunny morning. Emily entered nervously, expecting the worst news\r\npossible. She was already mentally ready for the news that she would soon lose\r\nher job.\nWhat the boss told her,\r\nhowever, was completely different. \"Well done! Your contribution to the\r\nbusiness has significantly increased. You have been promoted to the position of\r\nnew sales manager,\" he said.",

    "content": "January always feels bleak and long. January, or ‘NjanuWorry’ as it is\r\nknown, is extremely stressful for many people faced with the consequences of\r\nfestive season holiday splurges and back-to-school costs.\nSome say it’s the month that feels like a whole year, but finally, at\r\nmidnight, it will be over.\nThere are all sorts of life hacks available for those who want to make\r\nthe month of seemingly slow days more bearable. For instance, some try to get\r\nyou to focus on exercise and getting the body back in shape after the festive\r\nperiod excesses.\nSo at the start of the month, you begin to see people walking or even\r\njogging around the neighbourhood, and gyms see an uptick in membership. But by\r\nmid-month, the spirit has been weakened by the never-ending financial stress\r\nand the constant wishing for it to be February.\nAlso, let’s face it, some of us were way out of shape before the festive\r\nseason, and a month of frenetic exercise is not going to suddenly turn us into the\r\npicture we have in mind of the perfect body. Nevertheless, if it works for you,\r\ndo what you must.\nI never want it said that I discouraged people from trying every which\r\nway to look their best, even if it was clear that they were banging their heads\r\nagainst a brick wall.\nThen there are those who take up what is known as the Dry January\r\nChallenge. This entails quitting all alcoholic beverages for the month.\nHonestly speaking, I once thought of trying it, but the flesh was weak\r\nand the spirits were willing me to continue sipping them. I enjoy the occasional\r\ndrink with a meal, and after-work beers with colleagues have always been a\r\ngreat way to wind down the day.\nThe idea of quitting for a whole 31-day month seemed like too much to\r\nask. How the heck would I manage the NjaanuWorry tensions without the odd\r\nstress-relieving drink?\nI know what some of you are thinking at this point because society\r\ngenerally believes there are three types of people: those who do not drink at\r\nall, those who are problem drinkers or alcoholics, and drinkers who have no\r\nissues with alcohol.\nFrankly, I learned long ago how to cast off the shackles of fear and\r\nfalse beliefs to discover my own inner path. As such, I stopped worrying about\r\nwhat such people think of me. After all, as the saying goes, what you think of\r\nme is none of my business.\nI don’t claim to be one of those self-help gurus. In fact, I think many\r\nof them are a hoax. But perhaps that’s a topic for another day.\nWhat I do know, mainly from years of personal experience, is that we\r\nshould employ as many smart strategies as possible to stretch our money and\r\nensure it lasts through December to the next payday at the end of\r\nJanuary.\nNevertheless, every year, many of us allow ourselves to get carried\r\naway. This is why life appears to slow down every year without fail and become\r\nfilled with stress when the heat of January's financial struggles hits our\r\npockets.\nWe've all seen the memes and GIFs on social media, all saying things to\r\nthe effect that January is the Monday of months. Many have promised\r\nourselves and maybe even others that we will do better next year, and I say\r\ngood luck to you.\nThat said, I can predict most of us will be back here in 365 days,\r\nwondering how we let these ideals get away from us. However, if we are honest\r\nwith ourselves, we will know exactly how it happened.\nSo if you are reading this for advice on how to manage NjaanuWorry the\r\nnext time it rolls around, all I can say is, pole sana.\nMeanwhile,\r\nnow that the coins are jingling in the pocket and the crisp notes from the ATM\r\nare begging to be spent, at least February is a short month and this year it\r\nends on a ‘Furahiday’. It really is as if the year is already trying to make up\r\nfor the misery of the first month.",

    "content": "Schneider Electric./HANDOUT\nIn an era when climate change is no longer a distant threat but a lived reality, companies around the world are being pushed to take real action—especially on how they manage the carbon footprint of their supply chains.\nNow, a new tool from Schneider Electric is making that work a little easier, and more inclusive.\nThe platform, called Zeigo™ Hub, was launched this month with one goal: to help companies decarbonise their supply chains at scale.\nFor many, that means finally tackling what experts call Scope 3 emissions—those indirect emissions that happen outside a company’s direct operations but within its value chain.\n“A decarbonised supply chain is no longer a ‘nice to have’—it’s a strategic imperative,” said Laura Eve, Vice President of SaaS Sustainability Solutions at Schneider Electric.\nWhat sets Zeigo Hub apart from other tools is its focus on supplier engagement. Instead of just collecting data from suppliers, it helps them take action.\nThe platform walks them through measuring their own emissions, learning about sustainability, and taking steps to reduce their impact—no matter how small or new their business might be.\nSmaller suppliers often struggle to keep up with corporate sustainability demands.\nMany don’t have teams or tools to handle climate reporting.\nZeigo Hub tries to level that playing field.\nSuppliers are given access to toolkits, learning materials, and custom roadmaps—without having to pay. The companies that use their services pick up the bill.\nThis shift matters. For years, environmental responsibility has mostly been led by big brands. But real change, experts say, depends on the small and medium-sized players too—those often hidden in global supply chains.\nZeigo Hub also brings something new to the table: artificial intelligence.\nThe platform uses AI to simplify data entry and offer personalised support to users.\nIt’s part of Schneider Electric’s wider push into AI-powered sustainability tools, announced earlier this year.\nSince 2021, the company has helped more than 2,700 suppliers through programmes like Energize, Catalyze, and the Zero Carbon Project.\nNow, Zeigo Hub will act as the digital home for those efforts, allowing companies and suppliers to track progress together.\nData from Zeigo Hub is formatted to help with global climate reporting frameworks like CDP, CSRD, and TCFD—another headache often faced by sustainability teams.\n“It’s about turning ambition into action—empowering every supplier, every partner, and every organisation to contribute to a net-zero future,” said Eve.\nThe platform is now available worldwide. And while it may be just one tool in the broader climate fight, it offers something that’s been missing for many: a starting point.\nFor small businesses that want to do the right thing but didn’t know how—or couldn’t afford to try—Zeigo Hub could be the hand up they’ve been waiting for.",

    "content": "While many Kenyans would want to own some form of real\r\nestate, lengthy processes and prohibitive costs have made real estate ownership\r\nappear to be a preserve of the elite.\nHowever, over the past decade, advancements in technology\r\nhave made it easier for investors to acquire real estate assets without\r\nrequiring millions, lawyers or excessive documentation.\nThrough real estate tokenization, a process of converting\r\nphysical property into digital tokens that represent fractional ownership,\r\ninvestors can now purchase small, affordable shares or “tokens” each backed by\r\na verified asset on blockchain.\nThese tokens offer the flexibility that traditional real\r\nestate lacks, enabling people to buy, sell or hold real estate assets without\r\nbuying an entire property.\nTokenization also brings something rare to real estate:\r\nliquidity. Traditionally, selling property was slow and expensive.\nWith tokenized assets, investors can resell their tokens in\r\nsecondary markets whenever they choose. This introduces agility to a market\r\nthat has always moved slowly.\nIt is real estate investing with the convenience of stock trading,\r\nbut grounded in real-world assets.\nYeshara, a Kenyan blockchain-powered investment platform, is\r\none of the companies that is transforming how Kenyans and global investors\r\naccess property markets, offering secure, fractional ownership of real-world\r\nassets using digital tokens.\nWith Yeshara’s platform, users can invest in tokenized\r\nresidential and commercial properties starting from small amounts (USD 100).\r\nThis levels the playing field, giving everyday Kenyans a chance to participate\r\nin high-value real estate markets.

Duale, Abdirashid has led Dahabshiil’s expansion from a modest remittance service into a multi-faceted financial powerhouse.\nIts offerings now include Dahabshiil Money Transfer, Dahabshil Bank, DahabPlus, and eDahab—platforms that have become lifelines for families and businesses across continents.\nIn his acceptance speech, Duale expressed deep gratitude to the organizers and dedicated the award to the Dahabshiil Group team and Somali communities worldwide.\n“This award is a testament to the resilience and ambition of the Somali people,” he said.\n“At Dahabshiil, we remain committed to driving progress, supporting our diaspora, and building a brighter future for all.”\nThe award also shines a light on a remarkable family story—one that turned the pain of war and displacement into a global enterprise.\n“I often say I didn’t find Dahabshiil—Dahabshiil found me,” said Duale. “It was rooted in the struggles of our people and shaped by the values of our family.”\nToday, Dahabshiil is the largest African‑owned money transfer company in the world, serving customers in over 160 countries.\nUnder Duale’s stewardship, it has become a vital link between Somali communities and their homelands, providing affordable remittance services, mobile money, banking, and telecommunications.\nWhat sets Duale apart, award organizers said, is his deep commitment to serving those often overlooked by traditional financial institutions.\n“He embodies the mission of inclusive finance,” the awards committee stated.\n“Duale has built not just a company, but a platform of stability and hope across fragile and underserved regions.”\nFrom its humble beginnings in a small office, Dahabshiil has grown into a global enterprise, partnering with governments, NGOs, and international development institutions to deliver critical services in remote and post‑conflict areas.\nYet, despite its growth, the company remains firmly rooted in the values of community and resilience that shaped its founding.\nA passionate philanthropist, Duale has also invested deeply in the Horn of Africa and beyond—supporting education, youth training, health services, disaster relief, and other humanitarian causes.\nEach year, a significant portion of Dahabshiil’s profits is channeled into vital development and relief efforts.\n“This recognition is not just for me,” said Duale. “It’s for the hardworking families, the migrants, and the entrepreneurs who refused to give up. This is their story too.”\nThrough hard work, vision, and a profound sense of service, Abdirashid Duale has positioned Dahabshiil as both a global business powerhouse and a beacon of hope—a testament to the strength and resilience of the Somali people.",

    "content": "Netflix’s new bundling deal with French media giant Vivendi SE’s Canal+ is a strategic play to boost its African subscriber base as competition intensifies, particularly from homegrown platforms like the MultiChoice-owned Showmax.\nNetflix’s new bundling deal with French media giant Vivendi SE’s Canal+ is a strategic play to boost its African subscriber base as competition intensifies, particularly from homegrown platforms like the MultiChoice-owned Showmax.\nThe deal, which integrates Netflix into Canal+’s pay-TV offering across 24 Francophone African markets, will allow the US streaming leader to bypass longstanding hurdles around broadband access, payment friction and brand visibility, while gaining instant reach via Canal+’s 8 million subscriber network.\nIndustry experts say the deal offers a more streamlined user experience for Canal+ subscribers, who will access the Netflix platform via their existing subscription without the need for a new log-in. It also comes with the potential for Netflix to invest more in productions from the region.\n“If the numbers work out, this could very well motivate Netflix to put more money into local content from the region,” said Marie Lora-Mungai, a media entrepreneur and investor in Africa’s creative industries.\n“Adding Netflix to 400+ linear channels (including 28 African ones) and its own VOD catalogue, positions the group (Canal+) as the one-stop content gateway on the continent, just as Canal+ is getting ready to absorb Multichoice.”\nFor years, Netflix, Prime Video, Showmax and iROKOtv have vied for dominance in Africa’s nascent digital TV and video on demand streaming markets, which have high potential.\nAfrica had just over 5 million subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) users in 2023, but that figure is projected to triple to 15 million by 2029, according to Digital TV Research.\nStill, the terrain is unforgiving. Telco-led platforms like MTN’s VU and Vodacom’s Video Play have already folded, stifled by high data costs, low ARPU and insufficient local content.\nSince 2016, Netflix has invested more than $175 million (Sh22 billion) in Africa. Some $125 million (Sh16 billion) of that has gone to South Africa alone, supporting more than 7,000 jobs and contributing $178 million (Sh22.9 billion) to GDP, according to company data. Nigeria received over $23 million (Sh2.9 billion), generating more than 5,000 jobs.\nBut even with these figures, Netflix has struggled to overtake regional rivals. By late 2023, MultiChoice-owned Showmax had pulled ahead, commanding an estimated 39 per cent market share compared to Netflix’s 33.5 per cent, according to Omdia, a technology research and advisory group.\nThat translates to about 2.1 million subscribers for Showmax, versus Netflix’s 1.8 million.\nNetflix’s mobile-only plans average $6.75/month (Sh872), while Showmax's entry-level offers start around $4.83 (Sh624), with data-efficient features and language-localised interfaces like its recent Kiswahili rollout targeting more than 230 million speakers across East Africa.\nAgainst this backdrop, Netflix’s decision to bundle with Canal+ is no small move. The French pay-TV group has more than 8 million subscribers across Francophone Africa, a powerful springboard for Netflix into harder-to-penetrate markets.\nThe partnership offers subscribers seamless access through Canal+’s set-top boxes and integrated billing systems—solving Netflix’s persistent pain points around mobile data costs, digital payments and device fragmentation.\nCrucially, it also gives Netflix proximity to Canal+’s local content pipelines. Canal+ has built strong ties with regional studios like Marodi TV in Senegal (which broadcasts in the Wolof language) and Arewa24 in Nigeria (which prioritises the Hausa language). These networks offer rich creative ecosystems that Netflix may now tap into more systematically.\nThis partnership comes as Canal+ itself is expanding its influence. The company currently owns just over 45 per cent of MultiChoice, Africa’s largest pay-TV operator and owner of Showmax and DStv.\nIn early 2024, Canal+ launched a $1.96 billion (Sh253 billion) bid to acquire the MultiChoice shares. South Africa’s Competition Commission conditionally approved the deal inMay 2025, with a final decision expected by October.\nIf successful, Canal+ will control a bilingual content and distribution empire, uniting Francophone and Anglophone Africa under one umbrella and reinforcing its position as Africa’s most powerful content aggregator.\nThis could mark a turning point for Netflix. After years of aggressive expansion, the platform is now retrenching globally.\nIn 2023, Netflix cut 16 per cent of its original content slate, shifting from “volume to value,” according to an AInvest analysis. Amazon Prime Video has followed suit, recently pausing local content development across several African markets.\nFor Netflix, collaboration may be the clearest path forward. The Canal+ bundling model allows it to stay relevant, local and cost-effective in markets where direct dominance remains elusive.\nBlessing Waweru, a film and theater studies educator at the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication, says the bundling model carries notable risks.\n“Bundling can dilute platform identities, making it harder for viewers to distinguish Netflix’s brand. It also risks creating content silos if libraries across services aren’t properly integrated,” he said.\n“And new challengers, like Nollyland, IbakaTV and various freemium telco platforms, are still pushing in.”\nStill, the signs of a regional realignment are clear. Africa’s streaming future will be hybrid, collaborative and deeply rooted in local culture.\nWaweru, who is the former head of strategy at Protel Studios, said the collaboration is an “exciting development” for the ecosystem.\n“It means the next African breakout series might not come from Johannesburg or Lagos, but from a modest studio in Dakar, produced in Wolof and streamed to millions via a French-owned satellite box backed by a US tech giant.”",

The Change.org petition, created by the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety, also points to arguments questioning both evidence and witness accounts in the case.\nNewsom has not commented on the request.\nLanez had seven US top 10 albums in the seven years before his conviction.

Later, the\r\nprincipal of the school was interviewed on national television.\n“Who wrote the play?” he was asked.\n“I did,” he answered in a tone that lacked\r\nconviction.\nA short while after, a former postgraduate\r\nstudent of mine, who had been a good actor, walks into my office at the\r\nUniversity of Nairobi.\n“Professor, I’m the one who wrote that\r\nplay,” he said without blinking.\n“Which play?” I asked.\n“The winning play at the Kenya National\r\nDrama Festival, and I was paid Sh400,000,” he answered.\nI sensed he expected me to congratulate\r\nhim. But it was like he had punched me in the tummy. And believe me: I had to\r\nresist the temptation to spit on him.\nWhich brings me to the culture of cheating\r\nin our educational system. There are cartels in Nairobi and elsewhere who write\r\nmaster’s and PhD proposals for students. I’m told they even write the theses\r\nfor them.\nAn official at the Commission of University\r\nEducation, in a speech at the University of Nairobi, told us that they knew\r\nabout these illegal entities and even where they are located. And I was sitting\r\nthere and wondering: Then why can’t you do something about it?\nWhen I was working on my PhD at the\r\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz, my supervisors insisted on hearing my\r\nvoice in the writing. They would hear it in my diction, in my syntax and in my\r\ntone. I could not have cheated them even if I had wanted to.\nSo, my question is: Why don’t our Kenyan\r\nlecturers do the same? Why are they letting our students get away with work\r\nthat has been outsourced?\nSHODDY SCRIPT\nLet us now talk about the artistic quality\r\nof Malala’s scriptEchoes of War, which was reprinted in The Saturday Standard\r\nof April 12, 2025.\nIn the synopsis of the play, Malala tells\r\nus the following:\n“The play is a hyperbole attempt to\r\nillustrate the widening gap between two generations; the old and the young.”\r\nThe word ‘hyperbole’ is a noun, but here, the playwright is using it as an\r\nadjective, qualifying ‘attempt’. The proper form should have been ‘hyperbolic\r\nattempt’.\nBut even in its ungrammatical rendition,\r\nthe sentence sounds needlessly pompous and unworthy of a playwright. This might\r\nsound trivial, but the semicolon in the sentence should, in fact, be a colon.\nHyperbole is a figure of speech that refers\r\nto stylised exaggeration. The synonym is ‘overstatement’. However, I did not\r\nsee much of this in the script. And as I continued to read it, I started\r\nfeeling that the term he should have used is ‘melodrama’.\nAgain, in a clumsy attempt to sound clever\r\nand sophisticated, he misleads the Butere girls by misusing the terms ‘setting’\r\nand ‘exegesis’.\nMoreover, the plotting of this play is\r\npoorly done. The dramatic conflict is not well defined, and in whatever form it\r\nexists, it is not resolved. The theme of telemedicine is surreptitiously\r\nsmuggled into the text in an attempt to pander to the expectations of the young\r\ngeneration. But a more discerning audience would keep seeing it as an\r\nunnecessary imposition.\nPOLITICALLY MOTIVATED\nA cardinal rule in creative writing is that\r\nyou do not use art to settle scores. You write in good faith. You are sincere\r\nand honest about the message you are communicating to humanity. And the message\r\nis universal and timeless. But when an artist has an axe to grind, that is when\r\nhe or she slides into propaganda.\nA man goes through a divorce, for instance,\r\nand loses his sense of perspective. Then he writes a play demonising women,\r\ncompletely forgetting that he has a mother, sisters and daughters. So, you have\r\npropaganda right there.\nFor whatever reason, Cleophas Malala was\r\nditched by his party UDA, and instead of counting his blessings (for example,\r\nhow many Kenyans have been in those elevated positions?), he chose to hit at\r\nhis enemies through drama.\nIn other words, his motive for writingEchoes of Warwas not sincere and honest, to say nothing about a desire to\r\nfleece a school called Butere Girls. As a result, the play became preachy and\r\ndidactic. In a word, it degenerated into propaganda.\nIf you’re one of my usual detractors and\r\nyou doubt what I’m saying, tell me: How else is the audience expected to\r\ninterpret the phrase ‘Echoes of War’, which is smuggled into the script towards\r\nthe end, and then it becomes the title of the play?\nWe all know the meaning of the word ‘echo’,\r\nbut we haven’t been told about a war. So, what is the audience supposed to make\r\nof the collocation ‘Echoes of War’ other than to see it as some angry\r\npropaganda?\nThen you have actors in a fictitious\r\nkingdom in the Middle East who somehow, and I repeat somehow, know about a\r\ndrama festival taking place at a school called Chavakali, in the western part\r\nof a country called Kenya.\nFurther, the audience is treated to a\r\nspectacle involving young, impressionable actors shouting a bunch of political\r\nslogans reminiscent of the ones we heard from Gen-Zs during their\r\ndemonstrations last year.\nIf you think I’m dead wrong in\r\ncharacterising this as propaganda, feel free to write to UC Santa Cruz,\r\nrequesting them to recall the PhD they awarded me back in 1980.\nFinally, let us be clear: art and\r\npropaganda are like oil and water; they don’t mix. Propaganda messages are\r\ntypically one-sided, one-dimensional and simplistic. True art, including drama,\r\ntries to capture the depth, the subtlety, the nuance, the irony and the\r\ncomplexity of human experience.\nGood drama, like all good literature, is\r\nlife-affirming. It does not glorify war or violence. And from the point of view\r\nof composition, good literature is an ironic construct. I used to tell my\r\nstudents at the University of Nairobi that literature would be unthinkable\r\nwithout irony.\nLet me end where I began. Script writers\r\nwho have disgraced the drama festival and turned it into a commercial\r\nenterprise to siphon money from schools should apologise to the public and\r\nrefund the money they have stolen. Yes, I said it.\nAnd those drama teachers who feel\r\ninadequate can go back to school and take classes in stylistics and creative\r\nwriting. Your students deserve to be taught how to write plays. I’m sure their\r\nparents and guardians would agree with me.\nHenry Indangasi is a Professor Emeritus,\r\nUniversity of Nairobi",

    "content": "Diary,\nDiary,\nI know my life can seem more dramatic than most go through, but I do have my good days, too. Like most of you, I always face the day in the morning with the optimism of a salesman.\nI go through my morning ablutions believing everything will turn out okay. But since my patron saint must have been a court jester; the universe always conspires to mess things up.\nTaketoday, for instance. This afternoon, I found myself headed to prison.\nIt all started well at the hospital. I didn’t have a heavy patient load, and the most notable was a new older patient.\n“My buddy says you’re the best,” he said. “His name’s John. Remember him?”\nI didn’t know how to answer. I have a few patients called John. And does “Do I remember him?” mean he’s dead?\n“Ah, yes. John.” I began examining the man, hoping to change the topic. “How’s he doing?”\nThe man game me a look that could cut steel. “He’s, dead, doctor.”\n“Oh, I’m sorry. We must be talking about two different Johns. Breathe in for me, please.”\nNeedless to say, my new patient wasn’t too enthusiastic with me after that. So it was no wonder that he kept peeking at the chart as I filled out his information.\nSuddenly, he shot to his feet.\n“How dare you!” he roared.\n“What?”\n“It’s okay if you don’t like me, but did you have to write it on my chart?”\nI look at the chart, baffled. “What are you talking about?”\n“There!” He stabbed the clipboard where I had written, ‘Major SOB’ and underlined it. I couldn’t help but start laughing. “Yeah? What’s funny about calling me a son of a bitch?”\n“No, Haron,” I said. “That’s doctor jargon. It means ‘Major Shortness of Breath’.”\nOn the other end of the age spectrum, a six-year-old girl came to me with swollen tonsils. As usual, I engaged her in some back-and-forth during the examination.\n“So,” said I, “what do you want to be when you grow up?”\n“A doctor. I already play doctor with my brother.”\n“You do?”\n“Yes.”\n“What’s the first thing you do when he comes to you?”\nWith a straight face, she said, “I make him wait for two hours.”\nOf course, none of that warranted an arrest. What got me in hot water was a man who busted into my office, completely out of breath.\n“Doctor! You have to come with me.”\n“What’s the matter?” I asked.\n“It’s my wife. She’s about to give birth in an Uber.”\nI gathered my equipment and rushed outside. Without further ado, I went to the small car, threw the rear door open. I gently guided the woman to lay on her back and lifted her dress.\nShe slapped me so hard I saw stars.\n“What the hell’s wrong with you, pervert,” she screamed.\n“I’m here to deliver your baby.”\n“I’m not pregnant, you numbskull. She’s in the car behind.”\nAs it turned out, she was the grandmother-to-be and she was hell-bent on suing me for everything I have.\nBut first, I had to attend to her pregnant daughter. The daughter was so impressed, she convinced her mother not to sue, and I got invited to dinner.\nSo, I guess all’s well that ends well.",

That’s a hell of a long time to live.\nSee, 115 years ago, in 1910, Kenya was still part of the British East Africa Protectorate, a British colonial territory. It wouldn’t be renamed Kenya until 1920. Basically, Kenya is only 105 years old, so the old duke who kicked the bucket was 10 years older than Kenya.\nAnd no, I didn’t have all this history in my head. I had to consult Wikipedia for the deets. Also, no, I’m not fascinated by how ancient this guy was. It’s the idea of his quality of life before he died that has me worried.\nEither I read some place or someone told me that life goes full circle. We are born naïve and helpless and if we are lucky enough to die of old age, we end up behaving like small babies once more. If you ask me, that sucks on so many levels.\nThe idea of crapping my pants and peeing willy-nilly like a toddler scares me. Adult diapers? Heck, no! Also, having my kids drag me out in a blanket to bask in thesunlike drying maize gives me the jitters. But being in my late twenties, all that is far, far away. I’m like an astronaut worrying about the weather in Mars, having never been to the moon.\nYou know who is creeping closer to a date with his maker? My boss, Inspector Tembo. Although he also happens to be my father-in-law, I don’t know how old he is. Neither does my wife, Sgt Sophia. I doubt anyone knows. He might have been around when good old Noah was preparing for the flood.\nYou might be thinking, “Why not just ask him how old he is?”\nTwo reasons. One, it had been none of my business, untiltoday. Two, my boss won’t tell anyone how old he is. Not me, and not his own daughter. We’ve come to think it has something to do with his retirement. The man isn’t looking forward to receiving his matching orders yet, and having to spend his time counting the weaverbirds in the tree upcountry.\nThat said,today, he came to me with a very sombre request.\n“Son,” he said, “I’d like you to take me somewhere, but you have to promise me whatever happens there remains between us.”\nThis totally shocked me. For one, I’m surprised that he’d ask me to share a secret. But most of all, that he called me “son”. Never once has he used such an endearing term towards me.\n“Yes, boss,” I say. I’d thought of calling him “father” but I thought it a bit of a stretch. “Where are we going?”\nHe put a finger to his lips. “Shhhh! Do you want me to announce it to the entire neighbourhood?”\nOur journey led us down to the river and up the valley on the other side of Jiji Ndogo. It’s not an area we frequent a lot because it’s mostly forest. Actually, I’m impressed that Tembo is able to pick a path through the dense underbrush.\nFinally, we come to a clearing, in the middle of which is a small sagging mud-and-thatch house. It looks so old, Mau Mau fighters might have built it.\n“Damn,” I say. “If you tell me a witch lives here—”\nTembo clamps a hand over my mouth. “Are you stupid? She doesn’t like being called a witch.”\n“Who doesn’t?”\nJust then, a woman older than God emerges from the hut. “Hello, inspector. I guess you’re here for the youth potion?”",

    "content": "Play:Beyond Silence: JM Chronicles\nPerformed by:Chisaina Arts Play\nDates:October\r\n13, 2024: The National\r\nTheatre;\nApril 20, 2025: Jalaram Auditorium, Westlands\nThe staging of the play ‘Beyond\r\nSilence: JM Chronicles’is a milestone. The fact that we can\r\nfinally interrogate the history of this enigmatic man in Kenyan history is an\r\nachievement in itself in an era where stories of resistance to a creeping\r\ndictatorship are being suppressed, as seen with the Butere Girls play and the\r\nGenZ revolt.\nIt is commendable that new and varied\r\ntheatre spaces have opened up in Nairobi besides the usual outlets — Kenyatta\r\nNational Theatre, Alliance Francaise, Goethe Institute and Ukumbi Mdogo.\nIn recent times, the Oshwal Auditorium and\r\nthe Jalaram Auditorium have become venues in interrogating the contested\r\nhistories of Tom Mboya and now JM Kariuki.\nI commend both these communities for\r\nopening their spaces to hosting the Kenyan voice to tell our histories in\r\nsearch of answers to our hidden and suppressed stories of freedom and\r\nliberation.\nThe Tom Mboya play by Too Early for Birds\r\nhas been performed to critical acclaim over the last two years at the Oshwal\r\nAuditorium, and for that I say, “Hongera”.\nAnd now the Jalaram auditorium has given\r\nvoice, through Chisaina Arts, to the life of patriot JM Kariuki, a politician\r\nwho was loved and maligned in equal measure and was assassinated 50 years ago\r\non March 2, 1975.\nThe JM family have enthusiastically supported\r\nthis production and are still seeking proper closure to the death of their\r\nfamily patriarch.\nThe task now is for Too Early for Birds\r\nand Chisaina Arts to take the plays to the counties where there is real hunger\r\nfor new and creative theatrical works. We are in the 15th year of\r\ndevolution, and this expansion of our creative voices is long overdue.\nROAD TO DISILLUSION\nChisaina Arts did a commendable job in\r\ntelling the story of JM Kariuki, who famously said, “We do not want a Kenya of\r\nten millionaires and ten million beggars.” On March 2, 1975, JM’s remains were found in Ngong Forest by a\r\nherd boy. His hands had been chopped off, his eyes gorged out, his face burnt\r\nwith acid and left on an ant's nest. As of 2025, his murder remains unsolved.\nIt is a Herculean task to tell the story\r\nof JM in two hours. Chisaina Arts, through director Victor Muyekwe, made a\r\nvaliant attempt in painting broad strokes through history and enacting the\r\nthree main trajectories of JM’s history.\nThese are his Mau Mau phase, his dalliance\r\nwith the Kenyatta regime when he became a millionaire through state largesse\r\nand opportunity, and finally his disillusionment with the neocolonial state as\r\nhe realises the betrayal of the aspirations of the Kenyan people for land and\r\nfreedom, resulting in his assassination.\nThe story of JM needs to be told in much\r\ngreater detail through the different phases of his life since each weaves an\r\nintriguing mosaic in history. The performance started and ended with the voices\r\nof GenZ, who represent the new generation that demands a return to the ideals\r\nof a free, democratic, just and accountable Kenya.\nRecently, on the 50th anniversary of\r\nJM’s death, Nation Media Group and the Department of History at the University\r\nof Nairobi both interacted with the history of this remarkable man in history.\nJohn Kamau wrote in the Nation on March 5 about JM’s links with Apartheid Israel. JM\r\nhelped set up the National Youth Service in the vein of Israel’s Nahal\r\nexperiment, which integrated military discipline with national development, and\r\nprocured 45 scholarships to train Kenya's future intelligence officers and\r\npilots in Israel.\n“The Israelis, eager to cultivate strong\r\nties with the emerging Kenyan state, saw in him a willing and capable partner,\r\none who could navigate the complex interplay between former Mau Mau combatants\r\nand the newly forming government,” Kamau wrote.\nHe added that JM was “not only a man of\r\nmeans but also a power man draped in wealth and influence, with a rich\r\nportfolio spanning lucrative casino directorships, high-stakes gemstone trading\r\nand vast agricultural ventures”.\nThe Department of History and Archaeology\r\nhosted a lecture in JM’s honour at University of Nairobi Towers, Chandaria\r\nHall, on March\r\n27. It was titled: ‘JM\r\nKariuki’s Political History: His Legacy in Kenya’s Future’. The lecture was\r\ndelivered by Kamoji Wachira, who knew JM personally.\nCHILLING LAST HOURS\nThe play enacted in chilling fashion the\r\nlast hours of JM as he interacted with different state actors, culminating in\r\nhis shocking assassination and the consequent discovery of his body in a\r\nmortuary, labelled “unknown adult male”.\nKenya lost another son of the soil who\r\nrefused to betray the ideals of ‘land and freedom’, which the Mau Mau had taken\r\nup arms for.\nNot to take away from the positives of the\r\nproduction, I personally felt that there was too much stage time devoted to\r\ndealing with JM’s family life and the alleged salacious side of his character.\r\nThis could have been used more productively in telling his story as Jomo\r\nKenyatta’s personal secretary, his business acumen, the Israeli connection, the\r\nrelationships and tensions within the new emerging political and security elite\r\nof Kenyan society, and the after-death solidarity campaigns by the student\r\ncommunity in Kenya.\nI feel it is premature for Chisaina Arts\r\nPlay to move onto other productions as it announced at the end of the play.\r\nMuch more introspection is needed to make it not only a better production but\r\nalso fill the unfulfilled gap for Kenyan audiences who are just beginning to\r\nhear of the play.\nThe theatre group also needs to explore\r\nother more affordable and accessible venues that can reach diverse audiences.\nReviewed by Zahid Rajan\n[email protected]",

I know, it’s a week late, but still.\nI spent most of the\r\nholiday weekend doing the same thing I do almost every day — not much. There\r\nwas a case of a snatched phone that we couldn’t solve but did our dandiest best\r\nto try. I even chased down a suspicious-looking fella who only turned out to be\r\nrunning away because he saw me chasing him.\nIt reminded me of a\r\ntime when I was in Nairobi. I was waiting for a bus when someone snatched my\r\nphone. I ran after the thief, shouting,“Mwizi! Mwizi!”People\r\njoined in and helped me chase the thief. I could hear them behind me\r\nshouting,“Ndiye huyo! Kamata yeye!”\nA short distance down\r\nthe street, someone’s foot tangled with mine. I regained my balance and\r\ncontinued chasing the thief. Then someone else’s foot did the same thing, and\r\nonly then did I realise I was being deliberately tricked. I fell down and\r\npeople started stomping on me.\n“What are you doing?”\r\nI cried. “I’m the victim here.”\nOnly when I produced\r\nmy police ID did they believe me. Turns out, the thief had accomplices who ran\r\nbehind me, pointing and callingmethe thief. Mistaken\r\nidentity at its best.\nWhen we weren’t\r\nchasing an unsolvable theft, my partner Sgt Sophia and I did what nearly every\r\nKenyan does these days: We buried our noses in our phones and consumed mindless\r\nentertainment and bogus news.\nOne topical post had\r\nme laughing my brains out. It was a video of a re-enactment of “Way of the\r\nCross”. This is the time Jesus carried the cross on his back from his\r\ncondemnation before Pontius Pilate to his crucifixion on Golgotha. The Jesus in\r\nthis video was a tall black man with long, shaggy dreadlocks. He was dressed in\r\na white robe and leather sandals. The idea of a black Jesus always confounds\r\nme, but to each his own, I guess. Behind the man was a sizeable crowd doing a\r\ngood job of recreating the sombre mood that would’ve accompanied the\r\ncircumstances.\nHere’s the part that\r\nhad me cracking up like a fool. A guy comes out of nowhere and decides to ride\r\non the cross being lagged by “Jesus”. Of course, Jesus doesn’t appreciate the\r\nadded weight. He drops the cross, turns around and identifies the culprit. Without\r\na moment of hesitation, Jesus chops the man down with a karate kick to the\r\nstomach. The man falls down as Jesus nonchalantly picks up his cross and\r\ncontinues with his journey.\nIt left me wondering,\r\nif Jesus could do that to someone who interfered with his cross, what had he\r\ndone to those who had whipped him? Assuming that part was re-enacted too, that\r\nis. Oh, how I wish the video had started sooner than it did.\nBut while that\r\nimpersonation lowered the bar of expectations, I got to another post about a\r\nlanky Kenyan guy who has been impersonating a KDF officer. Now, while the\r\nveracity of the news in question is in… well, question, and knowing well that\r\neveryone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, the possibilities\r\nwere nonetheless interesting.\nSomeone pretending to\r\nbe a butcher and selling donkey meat is bad. Also bad is a samosa seller\r\nstuffing his samosas with cat meat. But for a person to play a military\r\nofficer, own a gun and live in a barracks? That’s a completely different\r\nballgame. That’s extrajudicial-killings bad. Unaccountable-deaths bad.",

I mean, seriously, what if the moon is only the sun at night?”\nYes, that’s our\r\nMwendaa. Sometimes very philosophical, most times bat-crap crazy. “I can’t even\r\nbe sure I was born,” was another gem from him.\n“Why?” I asked,\r\nif only to humour him.\n“Because I don’t\r\nknow my parents. That’s proof, isn’t it?”\nToday, another\r\ninteresting anecdote brightened up my day. An older gentleman, probably in his\r\nfifties, came to my office all innocent like.\n“Afande,\r\nhabari?”he says.“Naitwa Juma. Nimenunua shamba hapa Jiji Ndogo\r\njuzi.”\nHe goes on to\r\nnarrate how he employed some young men to help him move furniture into his new\r\nhome. During the move, he complained how his back ached and that he should\r\nprobably consider getting more comfortable seats.\n“Zii, zii,\r\nmzae,”said one of the men.“Chenye unahitaji ni ki-foreign. Ukitaka\r\nupone mgongo, saka ki-foreign, jo.”\n“And you\r\nwantmeto help you?” I ask him.\n“Si ndiyo. Sijui\r\nJiji Ndogo vyema.

It was the best score in my\r\nprimary school. I was called to Chavakali High School, but because of finances,\r\nmy dream of joining the school could not materialise,” he said.\nWith his parents unemployed, Twahir found himself admitted\r\nto a local secondary school where he was confronted with the reality of\r\novercoming numerous challenges.\nThe school, like many others in Kenya's rural setting, lacked basic\r\ninfrastructure, including enough classrooms, sufficient learning materials, and adequate teaching\r\nstaff.\nEven as his parents struggled to raise the minimum required\r\nschool fees, Twahir remained focused and excelled in his exams.\nHe scored an A minus—the best in the school's history—and\r\nbecame the top student in the sub-county.\n“It was a humbling experience for me to get the grade. I\r\nwished I could get the maximum points, but I was comforted by the reality that\r\nI did my absolute best,” he said.\nThe result shone a radiant ray of hope in Twahir's life and\r\nopened doors that would eventually redefine his future.\nHe was enrolled into the Equity Leadership Programme, which\r\ngave him the opportunity to work in one of the bank’s branches in Nairobi.\nThe earnings offered some relief but were still not enough\r\nto meet his family’s many needs.\n“My sister needed school fees. I had to step in. The\r\nearnings were a huge boost, but still, we had a deficit because the needs were\r\nextremely high,” he said.\nUpon completing the programme, he took up a job in a hotel\r\nin Nairobi to supplement his income.\nDue to mounting responsibilities and limited resources,\r\nTwahir could not join the university.\nBalancing support for his family and enrolling at the\r\nUniversity of Nairobi, where he was admitted to study Industrial Chemistry,\r\nbecame impossible.

But I had even forgotten about it\r\nbecause I was busy chasing bills. This programme changed my life,” he narrated.\nTwahir is now one of the few Kenyan youths pursuing higher\r\neducation in North America, thanks to KenSAP.\nAs a student of Banking and Finance at Claremont McKenna\r\nCollege, his future is now brimming with hope and potential.\n“As a student, I’m exposed to vast opportunities that I\r\ncould only dream of. I now have the best opportunity to dream again and make my\r\nlife better,” he added.\nKenSAP helps high-achieving, low-income Kenyan high school\r\ngraduates like Twahir gain admission to the most selective colleges and\r\nuniversities in North America—all with full financial aid.\nSince its founding in 2004, the organisation has placed 320\r\nstudents at top-tier institutions.\nIt is in line with this mission that KenSAP hosted a gala\r\ndinner on Wednesday to raise funds that will support high-performing students\r\nfrom underprivileged communities across the country.\nThe dinner featured an auction session where various items\r\nwere sold to the highest bidders, with all proceeds going directly into the\r\nKenSAP programme.\nKenSAP Executive Director Alan Davidson emphasised their\r\ncore mission:\n“Our goal is to support underprivileged Kenyan children in\r\naccessing education and opportunities that will better their lives.”\n“In terms of where the funding goes to, this event usually\r\nraises about 15 to 20 percent of our annual budget, and all of the proceeds go\r\nto support students, alumni, and our programming,” Davidson said.\n“This year, again, all of the proceeds will go. If we raise\r\n$90,000 net, it will be about 18 percent of our budget. Total income of the\r\nevent will probably be something like $120,000 or $130,000, but then there are\r\nexpenses. As you can see, it's expensive to be here.”\nAt least 20 students get the opportunity to benefit from\r\nthis life-changing initiative each year.\nA number of factors are considered when selecting\r\nbeneficiaries.\n“We've been taking students from all across Kenya, including\r\nfrom the refugee camps in Kakuma and Dadaab. Academic credentials are based on\r\nwhere you went to school,” he explained.\n“So a student from a top national school scoring an A might\r\nnot be surprising, but for a student in a local day school to get an A\r\nminus—that's huge. We factor in all these dynamics to identify the most qualified\r\ncandidates for the program.”\nWhile guiding its students through the admissions process,\r\nKenSAP also prepares them for American campus life—academically and\r\nculturally—and provides long-term support throughout their undergraduate\r\nstudies and beyond.\nAt the most basic level, the financial aid granted to\r\nKenSAP's 320 undergraduates represents more than $100 million in educational\r\naid to Kenya.\nThe program's broader societal impact is more difficult to\r\nquantify, but with more than half of KenSAP's graduates already contributing to\r\nKenya’s economy—working in local firms, multinational companies, and NGOs—the\r\nreturns are evident.",

    "content": "On May 15, in the Iranian calendar, we honor the celebrated poet Hakim Abolghasem Ferdowsi, whose tireless efforts have profoundly shaped Persian language and literature.\nCulture and civilisation live on through enduring, expressive tongues—and it is through masters like Ferdowsi that Persian prose and poetic rhythm have reached their extraordinary heights.\nFerdowsi’s ‘Shahnameh’stands as his crowning achievement and a cornerstone of Persian literature.\nHe embarked on this epic at a time when Persian had matured enough to tackle diverse themes but still lacked a standardized form, with each region and city speaking its own distinct dialect.\nHe is traditionally thought to have embarked on the Shahnameh at around thirty years of age, adapting Abu Manṣur’s earlier prose version, though his command of verse and the use of oral legends imply he may have been composing related passages even in his youth.\nHe completed the first recension in 384 AH (994 CE), three years before Maḥmud of Ghazna’s accession, and delivered the final edition on 8 March 1010 CE (400 AH), at the age of seventy‑one.\nThe era of Ferdowsi marks the golden age of Iranian epic poetry. During this period, Masʿud Marwazi, Daqiqi, and Ferdowsi each produced their own triad of epic works, a creative surge that not only popularised the prose narrative of heroic and national tales but also set the stage for a flourishing of new epics under the Seljuk dynasty.\nHis mastery of oratory rests on the foundation laid by his forebears—those who, over more than a century, enriched Persian, refined its grammar, and elevated its artistic expression.\nHe acknowledged that, without their labours in maturing the language and its poetic forms, the Shahnameh could never have been realised.\nThough critical of philosophers who sought to prove God’s existence through intellect or sentiment, Ferdowsi believed that divinity reveals itself simply through creation’s unity and power. Thus, he worshipped without disputing theology, focusing instead on righteous action.\nThroughout his poetry, he extolled wisdom—deeming it the foremost of all creations, the source of salvation, and the greatest gift bestowed by God.\nWisdom, Ferdowsi teaches, is the wellspring and currency of all virtue. Every aspect of life—its trials, its joys, and its sorrows—stems from the presence or absence of this guiding insight.\nA truly wise individual, by living according to a deliberate and structured plan, continually progresses toward the pinnacle of human potential.\nFerdowsi is widely honored with the title \"Hakīm,\" a term that, in Persian culture, denotes a sage or philosopher.\nHis extensive scholarship and deep engagement with the cultural and historical narratives of his time exemplify these qualities, solidifying his reputation as a true \"Hakīm.\"\nFerdowsi identifies a range of moral virtues as the foundation and expression of true wisdom: refraining from improper behavior, practicing patience and gentleness, avoiding haste, arrogance, and pride, acknowledging the worth and dignity of others, shunning materialism, speaking with discernment, keeping the company of the wise, and guiding the ignorant toward understanding—all rooted in obedience to God.\nHis work, beyond its poetic brilliance, was also a scholarly endeavor. He did not merely craft legends; rather, he carefully gathered and curated historical and cultural material from the vast body of knowledge available to him. Through this effort, he created a timeless epic that preserved the collective memory of Iranians, Turks, and Indians alike.\nFerdowsi was a poet of profound moral vision who rose to prominence during the Samanid era, playing a vital role in safeguarding the Persian language from forces that sought to diminish or erase it.\nHis monumental work, theShahnameh, composed of some 50,000 couplets, remains a cornerstone of Persian literary heritage and a living testament to the language’s richness and vitality in the modern world.\nTheShahnamehhas been translated into most of the world’s major languages, and one of its treasured manuscript copies is preserved in the Florence Museum in Italy.\nAli Pourmarjan, cultural counsellor, Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nairobi.",

    "content": "After a seven-hour drive weaving through the scenic\r\nlandscapes of Central Kenya, I ­finally arrived at the breathtaking Samburu\r\nSopa Lodge.\nIt’s nestled deep within the heart of Samburu National\r\nReserve.\nThe journey from Nairobi to Samburu was nothing short of\r\nmagical: endless stretches of savannah, occasional glimpses of wildlife and a\r\ngrowing anticipation for what promised to be a one-of-a-kind launch — the of­ficial\r\nunveiling of Astro Tourism in Kenya.\nFor those who prefer to skip the road trip, there’s the\r\noption of a 50-minute flight from Wilson Airport to Samburu Kalama Airstrip,\r\nfollowed by a 45-minute drive to the lodge.\nEither way, the destination is worth every mile. Set against\r\nrugged hills and vast wilderness, Samburu Sopa Lodge rises like a mirage,\r\nblending seamlessly into the landscape with its traditional Samburu-inspired\r\narchitecture.\nIt’s a living tribute to local heritage, and proudly staffed\r\nby sons and daughters of the community.\nIt was here, beneath Samburu’s unpolluted skies, that Sopa\r\nLodges, in partnership with Leo Sky Africa, launched their visionary new\r\nproduct: Astro Tourism.\nIn a time where light pollution and urban sprawl have dulled\r\nthe brilliance of our night skies, this initiative promises to reconnect us\r\nwith the cosmos, not just as tourists but also as learners, storytellers and\r\nguardians of culture.\n“In an age where light pollution clouds our skies, the\r\nstars, once a source of wonder, navigation and cultural storytelling, are fast\r\ndisappearing from view,” the event’s opening statement reminded us.\nYet here, amidst Samburu’s serenity, the stars shine\r\nunapologetically bright.\n“It is a proud moment for us at Sopa Lodges to introduce our\r\nlatest innovation — Astro Tourism,” said Kennedy Ayoti, chief operating of­ficer\r\nof Sopa Lodges East Africa.\n“This innovative experience is a game changer in the region,\r\ncombining Samburu’s naturally dark skies with rich community narratives and\r\ncultural beliefs surrounding celestial events.\n“With the introduction of Astro Tourism, Sopa Lodges now\r\nproudly offers a ‘special six’, adding the stars to our iconic Samburu special ­five.”\nSETTING SIGHTS HIGHER\nFrom the moment the sun dipped below the horizon and\r\ndarkness fell, the atmosphere transformed.\nGuests gathered around a camp­ re while trained astronomers\r\nand Samburu elders took us on an awe-inspiring journey through the cosmos.\nWe weren’t just identifying constellations or spotting\r\nmeteor showers. We were experiencing the sky as the Samburu people have for\r\ngenerations — through stories, songs and spiritual connections.\nRosemary Kuria, director of sales at Sopa Lodges, emphasised\r\nthe deeper vision.\n“This unique, immersive experience invites our guests to\r\nconnect with the cosmos in ways that are educational, culturally enriching and\r\ndeeply respectful of the natural environment,” she said.\n“Now, we are setting our sights even higher.” And truly, the\r\nskies here are unlike any other.\nKenya’s equatorial position provides a rare celestial window\r\ninto both the northern and southern hemispheres — a dream for astronomers and\r\nastrophotographers alike.\nKimani wa Nyoike, expert astronomer and founding director of\r\nLeo Sky Africa, said their role is to guide and support the trained astronomers\r\nin delivering immersive and insightful stargazing experiences.\n“Samburu offers some of the most pristine night skies in the\r\nworld,” he said.\n“It is truly an exceptional setting for connecting people\r\nwith the universe.”\nKimani Wa Nyoike, expert astronomer and Founding Director of Leo Sky Africa/MIKE NTHEI\nSUSTAINABLE TRAVEL\nBut Astro Tourism is more than stargazing. It’s a holistic\r\nand sustainable travel model that celebrates indigenous knowledge while\r\ninvesting in the local community.\nWith eco-friendly practices at its core, the programme\r\nprovides employment, training and cultural exchange opportunities, ensuring\r\nthat Samburu’s natural and cultural heritage thrives for generations.\nThis powerful blend of science, heritage and sustainability\r\nsets a new benchmark for experiential tourism in Kenya and across Africa.\n“Astro-tourism is an immersive experience that invites\r\ntravellers and photographers to explore the night sky, while engaging with the\r\nscience and stories behind celestial phenomena,” Kimani said.\n“At Samburu Sopa Lodge, we aim to make the cosmos accessible\r\nand fascinating for everyone, whether you are a seasoned astronomer or a\r\ncurious novice.\n“It is about connecting with the universe in an enlightening\r\nand entertaining way.”\nAt the heart of this initiative is a powerful fusion of\r\nastronomy and indigenous knowledge.\nVisitors gather around the bonfire under Samburu’s\r\ncrystal-clear skies, where trained astronomers, local community members and\r\nguests share captivating interpretations of the stars, blending scientific\r\ninsight with traditional Samburu storytelling.\nThis integration of culture and science offers a deeper and\r\nmore meaningful understanding of the cosmos, while honouring the customs of the\r\nlocal community.\nAnd by promoting responsible travel, Astro Tourism ensures\r\nthat guests enjoy the beauty of the night sky, while helping preserve Samburu’s\r\nnatural and cultural heritage for future generations.\nABOUT THE LODGE\nFounded in 1986, Sopa Lodges has long been known for\r\noffering authentic safari experiences in Kenya and Tanzania.\nIts properties include Masai Mara Sopa Lodge, Lake Naivasha\r\nSopa Resort and Tarangire Sopa Lodge.\nThis new venture into Astro Tourism takes their legacy a\r\nstep further — from the plains to the stars.\nAs I stood under Samburu’s dazzling night sky, I couldn’t\r\nhelp but feel deeply moved.\nThis wasn’t just a launch, it was a reawakening.

    "content": "BY BRIAN OBARA\nThe breathtaking beauty of Kenya’s Masai Mara defies description. It is a land where the wild world reveals itself in stunning clarity, where lions rule over sun-soaked savannahs, where epic herds of wildebeests, zebras and gazelles wander ancient migration paths, and where elephants and giraffes walk the earth like living myths straight out of the pages of the National Geographic.\nMother Nature loves to put on a show, and the Masai Mara is her most spectacular masterpiece. It’s also the home of Royal Zebra River Safari Lodge, a jewel of luxury nestled against an untamed backdrop that offers an unparalleled experience of the Mara’s wonders.\nThey say no two trips to the Masai Mara are ever alike, and after four unforgettable days in the lap of luxury at the Royal Zebra River Safari Lodge, I can vouch for this with conviction. The adventure began on a sun-drenched September afternoon when our guide, Philip Keter, welcomed us into his custom-built Toyota Safari Land Cruiser at the Mara’s Sekenani Gate.\nPhilip, a gold-level guide with an encyclopaedic grasp of the Mara’s wonders, instantly forged a warm and engaging rapport with us. His relaxed demeanour masked a profound understanding of the Mara’s ecosystem.\nHe’s the kind of guide who can effortlessly spot a yellow-fronted canary from a moving vehicle, while sharing captivating stories about hosting celebrities like Richard Branson and Bill Gates, as well as reminiscing about his years as a guide at Disney World’s Animal Kingdom. A grandfather of three and the author of several wildlife books, Philip made it abundantly clear that we were in the hands of a true expert.\n“The Mara is gold,” he said with a smile that reflected both the pride he had in this land and the joy he took in sharing it with guests.\n\"There’s no other place like it.”\nAs the days unfolded, Philip’s words rang true. The Royal Zebra River Safari Lodge, a new entry to the Mara's luxurious stays, opened in July 2024 and was already booked solid for months. We were fortunate to secure a booking.\nThe lodge, though new, felt as though it had always belonged, blending effortlessly into the natural landscape. From the outset, it was clear that Royal Zebra was not just another safari camp, it was an experience expertly crafted to ensure guests truly felt the pulse of the wilderness.\nThe Royal Zebra River Safari Lodge is perched on the banks of the Talek River, a shimmering lifeline that cuts through the Mara. The lodge’s architecture, with its spacious indoor and outdoor lounges, takes its cues from the landscape. Each of the eight luxurious glass-front suites is generously sized and offers a private retreat, complete with a balcony featuring a comfortable sofa and a dining table designed to let the outside world seep in.\nINTIMATE EXPERIENCE\nUpon our arrival, we were warmly welcomed with refreshments by Daniel Ndegwa, the camp manager, and his dedicated team. As he was checking us in, Daniel shared the lodge’s guiding philosophy with pride:\n“We believe in the little details, the thoughtful touches that transform a stay into an unforgettable memory.”\nHe certainly wasn’t exaggerating.\nThe camp’s size is intimate, with a maximum of 24 guests at a time, ensuring personalised service. Our detached suite was beautifully appointed, with large windows that opened onto stunning views of the Mara.\nThere was no television in the lounge, an intentional design choice to encourage guests to fully immerse themselves in the surroundings, but the fully stocked mini-bar, the plush bed and the spacious en-suite bathroom made it clear we weren’t roughing it. As the sun dipped beneath the horizon, we dined under the stars with a menagerie of dishes before us.\nChef Sammy had truly outdone himself. He and his team elevate the dining experience to an art form. Each meal was a carefully curated celebration of local and international flavours, designed to tantalise even the most discerning palate. One evening, we dined on a perfectly roasted lamb, accompanied by seasonal vegetables with a dessert that rivalled anything found in a five-star restaurant. The food alone was worth the trip.\nThe following morning, we drew back the curtains at dawn to witness one of the Mara’s most iconic experiences, a hot air balloon ride. As the sun began its ascent, more than 20 colourful balloons gracefully lifted into the sky, providing a breathtaking bird’s-eye view of the vastness below.\nFROMLIONS TO ELEPHANTS\nEvery day at the lodge was a new adventure. Philip would whisk us away in the cool morning air for a game drive that would reveal more of the Mara’s hidden treasures, from towering giraffes with their curious gazes to the blue-jean-clad topi racing across the plains.\nOne morning, we were fortunate enough to witness a pride of lions lazing by the road, their bellies too full from the night’s hunt to be bothered by the tourist-filled vehicles circling them. Another day, we watched as a lioness blended into the tall grass, stalking her prey with the precision of nature’s finest design. The scene played out like a documentary unfolding in real time.\nBy the Ntikitiak River, a pod of hippos lounged lazily in the shallows, their bulk deceptively hiding their speed, a fact confirmed by Philip, who compared their sprinting ability to that of Eliud Kipchoge.\nPhilip was quick to remind us that even though the Mara is known for its big game, the smaller creatures are just as important. He pointed out everything from the black-shouldered kite to the red-necked spurfowl, describing each with the care and reverence that only a true naturalist can convey.\nIn the afternoons, we returned to the lodge for lunch by the pool. By evening, the light changed again, casting long shadows across the plains. The animals became more active, and the drive became a race against the setting sun, as we tried to spot as much wildlife as possible before darkness fell.\nOne particularly memorable evening, we spotted a herd of elephants making their way to the river. Their sheer size and power was awe-inspiring against the backdrop of the rolling plains.\nAT ONE WITH NATURE\nA safari is only as good as the people who make it happen, and at Royal Zebra River Safari Lodge, the staff were the true heart of our experience. Daniel, the camp manager, who has more than 26 years of experience in the hospitality industry, shared his thoughts on what sets the lodge apart.\n“We have only one chance to impress our customers, and we want that first impression to last.”\nNdegwa’s leadership philosophy is reflected in the tight-knit team he oversees.\nCamp supervisor Eunice Njeri, who was ever smiling, said they are like a family there.\n\"The way we work together and support each other is what makes Royal Zebra so special,” she said.\nEach evening, as we returned to the lodge, we were met with attentive service and genuine warmth. Solomon Koriata, our waiter, seemed to anticipate our every need, while the ever-smiling Eunice made sure no detail was overlooked.\n“Our ultimate trophy is making the guest happy,” she said.\nThen there was Derrick Loso, the lodge’s affable bartender. Derrick, who has a passion for mixology, delighted guests with his signature cocktail, 'The Royal Zebra Big Five', a potent blend of rum, gin, vodka and more, topped with regular Coke.\n“This drink embodies the spirit of the Mara,” he said with a grin. And after tasting it, I had to agree. It was strong, bold and unforgettable, much like the lodge itself.\nOn our final morning, we were treated to a specially prepared surprise breakfast by the pool. The setting was perfect. The sun rising over the Mara, the cool breeze carrying the sounds of birds and Maasai Morans jumping and dancing in celebration. It was a fitting end to an unforgettable stay. As we left the lodge, Philip turned to us with a smile.\n\"You’ll be back,\" he said confidently.\nAnd he’s probably right. Because while no two trips to the Mara are ever the same, I have no doubt that every trip to Royal Zebra River Safari Lodge will be just as magical as this one.\nAs we passed through the Sekenani Gate once more, we felt as though we had been let in on a secret; a place where the world still worked in harmony with nature.\nFor those seeking an authentic yet luxurious safari experience, the Royal Zebra River Safari Lodge offers something truly special. Whether you come for the Great Migration, the wildlife or simply to reconnect with nature, you’ll find that the Royal Zebra delivers an experience unlike any other",

    "content": "The crowd at a past concertAs our motherland\r\nambulates towards the next general election, the youth are emerging as both a\r\nvolatile and visionary force within the political landscape.\nRaised on the\r\nimmediacy of social media, shaped by post-pandemic economic frustrations and\r\ndisillusioned by the unmet promises of the Kenya Kwanza administration, this\r\ngeneration is redefining protest through culture rather than conventional\r\nactivism.\nWhere traditional\r\navenues of political engagement seem co-opted or ineffective, art, music,\r\nfashion and digital satire have become the new battlegrounds.\nIn 2024 and 2025, the\r\nnexus between politics and expressive cultures has intensified, with genres\r\nlike Gengetone and Arbantone, viral skits, street graffiti and TikTok\r\ncommentary serving as visceral outlets of youth anger and aspirations.\nThese, what once\r\nseemed peripheral or apolitical artistic ejaculations, now function as an\r\naesthetic rebellion against a system perceived to have failed its youngest\r\ncitizens.\nThis is the context\r\nthat empowers us now to situate popular youth art today, such as\r\nGengetone, within this broader context of creative resistance, reading it not\r\njust as music but as a mirror of youth consciousness, a chronicle of urban\r\nprecarity, and a sonic manifesto for political reckoning in a country on the\r\nbrink of generational transformation.\nTo a keen critic, a\r\nsonic insurrection appears to be brewing around us today in the\r\ndisquieted soul of Kenyans between ages 18 and 35, and the local music they\r\nprefer both in public and private spaces. Emerging from the congested arteries\r\nof estates to the east of the capital city and the swelling frustrations of the\r\nunderemployed youth, Gengetone and its contemporary mutation, Arbantone, speak\r\nnot merely as music but as an ideological act of resistance.\nThe political valence\r\nof these two genres on our national music scene can be read, in part, as a\r\nsymbolic performance of protest under the Kenya Kwanza administration and its\r\nantecedent regime. Gengetone, far from being a mere pastiche of global rap, is a\r\nsonorous index of our urban identity.\nThe term “genge”,\r\ndrawn from Kiswahili, means a mass or crowd, underscoring the music’s\r\ncollectivist ethos as musicbythe peopleforthe\r\npeople. Here, identity is constructed not within the sterile frameworks of\r\nnationalist ideals but through gritty, everyday narrations of hustling, street\r\nsurvival and socio-sexual politics in a fast-changing country.\nSarah Nuttall inBeautiful/Ugly:\r\nAfrican and DiasporaAesthetics(2007) argues\r\nthat African cities serve as “aesthetic laboratories”, where marginalised\r\ncommunities re-inscribe their identities against imposed colonial and\r\nneoliberal orders.\nThe lewdness often\r\nascribed to Gengetone is not a moral failure but an aesthetic choice, a\r\nweaponisation of vulgarity to expose the hypocrisy of a state that demands\r\ndecency while failing to dignify its citizens. These creative acts serve as\r\ncoded performances of dissidence, asserting an identity that is proudly\r\nanti-elite and subversively self-authored.\nFrom Ethic’s rawLamba\r\nLoloto Mbogi Genje’s cryptic street anthems, Gengetone and its\r\noffshoots operate as subaltern historiographies. The mainstream media, entwined\r\nwith elite interests, offers sanitised versions of the nation’s progress, often\r\nmasking the growing economic disillusionment under the current administration.\r\nIn contrast, youth-driven art provides what I call sonic disruptions that\r\nnarrate the realities of our land from the bottom up.\nNuttall’s emphasis on\r\naffective intensities is instructive here. The rawness of the lyrics, the\r\nchaotic beats, the carnivalesque performances are affective expressions of\r\nalienation. The genre’s performers are not merely entertainers; they are\r\nhistoriographers, exposing state-sanctioned violence, corruption and neglect\r\nthrough the intimate geographies of sound. To dance toNgwaiis\r\nto momentarily forget unemployment. To chantWamlambezis\r\nto reclaim joy from the jaws of despair.\nToday, urban youth\r\nmusic gangs, Instagram circles and YouTube channels like Wanati Entertainment,\r\nform ephemeral but powerful nodes of mobilisation. They are webs of protest\r\nthat lead to escape from formal institutional regulation. These subcultures\r\nfunction as alternative civic spaces, where solidarity is forged through shared\r\naesthetics and political rage.\nIn the state of our\r\ncountry now, where economic promises ring hollow and neoliberal austerity bites\r\nhardest on the youth, protest youth music’s informal ecosystems become stages\r\nof civic dialogue with a young electorate.\nPerformers like Ssaru\r\nand Trio Mio are not only pop-cultural icons but also nodes of social memory,\r\nembodying the ideologies of youthful political awakening. In their lyrics, we\r\nhear the subtle mobilising call for autonomy, agency and transformation.\nGengetone has\r\nblossomed into a profound force in just half a decade, transforming the urban\r\nsprawl into vibrant epicentres of youth cultural revolution. Amidst the sterile\r\nmarch of neoliberal urbanism, an attempt to cleanse the city into polished\r\narenas of consumption, this genre boldly reclaims the streets, turning them\r\ninto arenas of dissent. With every beat, it sculpts the very air with defiance,\r\nechoing the pulse of a generation unafraid to question its place.",

    "summary": "In trying to suppressEchoes of War, the authorities have only amplified its significance\nIn trying to dismiss the BBC’sBlood Parliament, they have only deepened public mistrust",
    "content": "Earlier this week, the BBC\r\nreleased a harrowing documentary,Blood Parliament, exploring how\r\nunarmed Kenyan protesters were gunned down outside Parliament during theJune 2024anti-tax demonstrations.\nProduced by BBC Africa Eye,\r\nthe film identifies individual members of the security forces responsible for\r\nthe killings, using forensic visual analysis to reconstruct the events.\nAs a BBC spokesperson told\r\nthe Daily Nation, the state was quick to intervene. \"A screening of BBC\r\nAfrica Eye'sBlood Parliamentin Kenya was cancelled due\r\nto pressure from the authorities,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe exposé and the state’s\r\nreaction to it have reignited pressing debates about the nexus between art and\r\ncensorship, truth and power, and the place of artistic expression within the\r\npolitical and moral architecture of the Kenyan state.\nAs a literary critic, I am\r\nnot surprised. Ours is a country with a proud but turbulent tradition of\r\nartistic activism. Truth-telling through the arts is embedded in our cultural\r\nDNA, passed down through generations of writers, performers and poets who have\r\nresisted power with nothing but metaphor, satire and song.\nAt the centre of this\r\ntraditiontodayisEchoes of War, a\r\nprovocative student play written by former UDA secretary general Cleophas\r\nMalala and performed by Butere Girls’ High School. The play echoes the\r\nfrustrations of a disillusioned youth, presenting a dystopian kingdom plagued\r\nby generational disconnect and authoritarian repression.\nTo interrogate the\r\nintersection of art and censorship is to enter a profoundly philosophical and\r\nmoral terrain. Why does art provoke such fear in insecure regimes? Why does\r\ncensorship so often target youth-led expressions? And what does this reveal\r\nabout the epistemological authority of the state?\nAt its core, censorship is\r\nan epistemic act. It is about controlling what can be known, remembered or\r\nimagined. The state’s reaction toEchoes of Warand the\r\nbroader Gen Z protests reflects an enduring ideological belief: that power must\r\nmonopolise truth.\nFrom a moral standpoint,\r\nthe use of state violence to suppress dissent, whether in the streets or on the\r\nstage, is indefensible. The forensic evidence presented in the BBC documentary\r\nconfirms that unarmed youth were killed while protesting the Finance Bill. This\r\nbrutality stands in stark contrast to our constitutional promise of the right\r\nto peaceful assembly. When a state kills its citizens for expressing dissent,\r\nand then suppresses the art that attempts to narrate and mourn that loss, it\r\nforfeits moral legitimacy.\nThere is a compelling\r\nethical parallel in the character of Mustafa, the protagonist ofEchoes\r\nof War. A young tech innovator, he creates a life-saving telemedicine app\r\nbut is later persecuted for his past criticism of the regime. The message is\r\nunambiguous: innovation and dissent are not mutually exclusive. Ethical\r\ngovernance should embrace critique as a sign of civic vitality, not treat it as\r\na threat.\nCensorship, especially when\r\nit targets art, often disguises itself in moralistic language: protecting\r\npublic order, shielding children, preserving cultural values. But as Emily Knox\r\nof the National Coalition Against Censorship has noted, this merely cultivates\r\na culture of fear. Writers grow hesitant. Artists self-censor. Citizens fall\r\nsilent, not from lack of ideas but from fear of retribution.\nWe are no strangers to such\r\nrepression. During the long shadow of the Nyayo presidency, writers like Ngugi\r\nwa Thiong’o were imprisoned and exiled for their work. His novelDevil\r\non the Cross, written on prison-issued toilet paper, remains a testament to\r\nboth the brutality of censorship and the resilience of the creative spirit.\nToday, we are witnessing a dangerous return to those\r\npatterns. Arrests of playwrights, bans on performances the use of tear gas\r\nagainst students at drama festivals — these are not isolated incidents. They\r\nare evidence of a state retreating into fear, desperate to contain a population\r\nthat is becoming increasingly politically conscious and creatively defiant.\nOur youth, who now form the\r\nmajority of our national population, are digital natives. They are documenting\r\ninjustice in real time, organising via encrypted chats, and creating art that\r\nbypasses traditional gatekeepers.\nThe Gen Z protests were\r\nabout more than taxation; they were about dignity, democracy and\r\naccountability. In this context, art becomes both archive and arsenal — a means\r\nof remembering and a method of resistance.\nTo attempt to straitjacket\r\nartistic expression for political expediency is not merely undemocratic; it is\r\nshortsighted. History teaches us that regimes that suppress art rarely outlive\r\ntheir own paranoia. Art, on the other hand, endures. Plays, poems, songs and\r\ndocumentaries become the living memory of resistance. They speak long after the\r\ntear gas has cleared.\nIn trying to suppressEchoes of War, the authorities have only amplified its significance. In trying\r\nto dismiss the BBC’sBlood Parliament, they have only\r\ndeepened public mistrust. The moral of this moment is not veiled; it is loud\r\nand clear: the suppression of art is the suppressionof truth.\nAs a country we stand at a\r\ncrossroads. One path leads toward a tightly controlled society, where creative\r\nexpression is sacrificed for political convenience. The other, though less\r\ncomfortable, affirms art as critique, mirror, and dialogue. To jail artists is\r\nto jail the national imagination. And a country that fears its own imagination\r\nis already unravelling.\nArt is not the enemy. It is\r\nthe conscience of a nation. And when that conscience is silenced, it is not\r\nonly artists who suffer—but the society that forgets how to feel, to question,\r\nand ultimately, to hope.",

    "summary": "World Book and Copyright Day fetes books as vessels of knowledge, culture and creativity",
    "content": "On Wednesday,\r\nKenyans joined the rest of the world in celebrating World Book Day. In\r\nevery corner of the globe, from grand libraries to quiet classroom corners, the\r\npower of books was acknowledged.\nMore than just printed\r\npages, books are bridges: between the past and the future, across generations\r\nand geographies, from imagination to understanding. It is a celebration not\r\njust of stories but of the very act of reading.\nAt its core, World\r\nBook and Copyright Day is a universal call to recognise the scope of books as\r\nvessels of knowledge, culture and creativity. The 2025 theme, ‘Read Your Way’,\r\nunderscores a simple yet profound truth: the relationship each reader builds with\r\na book is as unique as a fingerprint.\nIn some places,\r\nchildren were encouraged to dress as their favourite literary characters,\r\nsparking excitement and laughter in classrooms across the Global North. But\r\nbeneath the costumes and cheer lies a serious cause, reviving a reading culture\r\nthat has, in recent times, flickered in the shadows.\nWorld Book Day was\r\nborn from a dream. In 1922, Vicente Clavel, director of the Cervantes\r\npublishing house in Barcelona, proposed a day to honour the famed author Miguel\r\nde Cervantes.\nFirst celebrated\r\non October 7, 1926 (Cervantes’ birthday), the date was later shifted\r\nto April 23, the day he died. This change established an enduring tribute,\r\nnot only to Cervantes, author of the belovedDon Quixote, but also\r\nto literary figures like William Shakespeare and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, who\r\ndied around the same time.\nThis day, rich in\r\nhistorical meaning, has since grown into a global movement. It reminds us of\r\nbooks’ ability to unite people in thought, spirit and purpose.\nTo celebrate World\r\nBook Day is to reaffirm the joy of reading, not as a task but as a delight.\r\nWhether it’s an escape into fantasy or a quiet moment with a biography, reading\r\ncan be as intimate as a whispered secret or as thrilling as a drumbeat in the dark.\nAnd like any good\r\nhabit, reading begins with small steps. Just 15 minutes a day, they say, is\r\nenough to begin a journey that lasts a lifetime. Setting realistic goals,\r\nperhaps a book a month, can transform reluctant readers into passionate\r\nbibliophiles. From there, reading styles, such as skimming, scanning and\r\nintensive reading, help refine how we engage with texts.\nBut more importantly,\r\nreading allows us to understand the world and ourselves. Phonics, vocabulary,\r\nfluency and comprehension form the foundation of literacy. Without these five\r\nskills, no subject in school, no task in life, can be fully understood.\nIn our motherland, the\r\nCompetency-Based Education system champions real-world learning and mastery of\r\nskills. Reading, therefore, is not just a means to pass exams. It is the\r\nbeating heart of education. It empowers learners to think critically, communicate\r\nclearly and act responsibly.\nBooks become more than\r\ncompanions — they are tools for self-discovery, instruments for civic\r\nparticipation and sources of lifelong learning.\nDespite the known\r\nbenefits, Africa, like many parts of the Global South, struggles with poor\r\nreading cultures. Locally, factors such as a lack of reading materials,\r\nunder-prepared teachers, limited libraries and home environments where reading\r\nis not modelled or encouraged continue to stunt the growth of this culture.\nResearchers in this\r\narea identify the absence of parental literacy, over-reliance on school\r\ntextbooks and insufficient leisure reading materials contribute to the slow\r\nuptake of voluntary reading. As a result, many children grow up viewing reading\r\nas a chore rather than a choice.\nThere is hope,\r\nhowever, and it lies in community. Book clubs, whether in schools or among the\r\ngeneral public, offer a reasonable, practical and viable solution. These clubs\r\nturn reading into a shared adventure.\nThey provide safe\r\nspaces for discussion, debate, and discovery. A book club is not just a meeting\r\nabout a book — it is a gathering of minds, often from different generations,\r\nunited by curiosity and conversation.\nWithin these spaces,\r\nliterature becomes a mirror reflecting the society we live in and the society\r\nwe hope to build. Stories told aloud take on new meanings when filtered through\r\nthe experiences of others.\nEven more, book clubs\r\ncan foster empathy, build confidence in public speaking and broaden\r\nperspectives. They offer low-cost, high-impact ways to boost literacy and\r\ncritical thinking across communities.\nTo sustain this\r\nmomentum, our national and county governments have a role to play that cannot\r\nbe gainsaid. Libraries, once vibrant public spaces in the colonial and early\r\ndecades of our postcolonial era, are now sites that are seldom visited or\r\nacknowledged in our cultures of reading across the country and among the new\r\ngeneration of Kenyans. Many rural areas lack even a single functioning library,\r\nleaving students without access to books outside of school.\nIt is time counties\r\ninvested in building and refurbishing county and subcounty libraries. These\r\nshould stock books not only in English and Kiswahili but also in local\r\nlanguages. Promoting literacy in mother tongues alongside national and foreign\r\nlanguages creates a stronger sense of identity and inclusion.\nMoreover, libraries\r\nshould not just be warehouses of books but centres of learning and interaction.\r\nEquipped with Internet access, reading corners especially for children and the\r\nyouth as well as spaces for book clubs, these institutions can be engines of\r\nintellectual and cultural engagement.\nA nation that reads is\r\na nation that thinks. And a nation that thinks is one that grows. Reading\r\ncultures do not grow by accident; they are planted, watered and nurtured. They\r\nare born in homes where parents read aloud. They are sharpened in schools where\r\nreading is celebrated. They are expanded in clubs where books are discussed.\r\nAnd they are protected by governments that value education.\nThis World Book Day,\r\nlet us do more than wear costumes or read for an hour. Let us commit to\r\nbuilding a nation where books are as common as mobile phones and as valued as\r\ncurrency. Let us read not just for exams but for pleasure, for power and for\r\npeace. Yes, we can, readour way.",

    "content": "Flamboyant lawyer and author Atieno Ogolla/COURTESY\nFlamboyant lawyer Atieno Ogolla had thought that lawyering was about long hours in court arguing about how this crime was committed or not committed. It is after her sojourn into the practise of law that she harboured a great labour of love for writing.\nOgolla, a distinguished lawyer, author, and mentor, is set to unveil four transformative books on March 26, 2025, that aim to reshape legal education, practice, and spiritual growth for aspiring and practicing lawyers.\nAtieno’s pursuit for Alternative Dispute Resolution; also referred to as ADR, gave her excitement. She believed that protracted cases in courts could be resolved by the differing parties settling matters out of court.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is the mechanism of resolving disputes in any other form other than through the court process. Alternative justice processes include mediation, conciliation, negotiation, arbitration, and traditional dispute resolution mechanisms.\nShe is about to launch four books in the month of April following extensive research on various aspects of law. At 28, finding purpose in mentoring and writing fires her purpose of dispensing knowledge.\nShe is set to unveil four transformative books on April 30 that aim to reshape legal education, practice, and spiritual growth for aspiring and practicing lawyers.\nEach of her books provides a unique perspective on legal success, professional development, and the role of faith in the legal profession.\nIn her first book, titled “From Tradition to Modernity: The Role of ADR in African Justice Systems,” she deeply delves into the evolving landscape of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in Africa, exploring how traditional mechanisms of conflict resolution intersect with contemporary legal frameworks.\nAtieno provides a thought-provoking analysis of ADR's role in enhancing access to justice, particularly in a region where formal legal systems often face challenges of accessibility and efficiency. The idea of ADR first excited her when she thought of how it easily helped solve cases that could if left to courts drag for years.\n“My book on ADR implores on the importance of using it as an alternative way of solving disputes in our societies. If wholly embraced, ADR can be used ensuring that there is no backlog of cases in our courts across the country,” says Atieno.\nAtieno’s second book, “Beyond the Books: The Law Student’s Guide to Passing the Bar Exam” is a must-read for any law student preparing for the bar exam; this book offers practical strategies beyond rote memorization.\nDrawing from her experience as a legal educator and mentor, Atieno provides actionable study techniques, time management strategies, and exam-day readiness tips designed to help students excel and build confidence in their legal knowledge.\nThe third publication, “Lawyer in Progress: 365 Days to Success—Planner for Undergraduate and Bar Exam Students,” is more of an innovative planner for law students set to sit bar exams.\nFailing in bar exams has recently grown into a national concern. Last year, Attorney General Dorcas Oduor was moved by concerns raised by law students and stakeholders over mass failures in law exams offered by the Kenya School of Law (KSL) to form a body to investigate the failure.\nDorcas' move followed a consultative meeting she had convened and was attended by the President of the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), Chairpersons of the KSL, Council for Legal Education (CLE), the Kenya Law Reform Commission (KLRC) as well as their Chief Executive Officers.\nAccording to Atieno, this book is more than just an organisation - it is a structured guide designed to help law students and bar candidates set goals, track progress, and maintain focus throughout their legal journey. With daily prompts, study schedules, and motivational insights, it serves as a personal accountability tool to enhance productivity and success.\nIn her final book titled, “In His Court: A Year-Long Devotion for Future Lawyers,” Atieno is blending faith with the practice of law. This devotional provides daily reflections, scripture-based encouragement, and insights on navigating the legal profession with integrity and purpose. It is a spiritual companion for law students and young lawyers who seek to align their professional aspirations with their faith.\nSpeaking ahead of the launch, Atieno Ogolla shared, “These books are the culmination of my passion for law, education, and mentorship. Each of them addresses a critical gap in legal education and practice, offering students and practitioners the tools they need to succeed academically, professionally, and spiritually.”\nAtieno’s books can also introduce readers to the idea of and background to law. She introduces the reader to how the law relates to everyday life by discussing the structures of as well as the relationships between the people and the Constitution, Parliament, the central government, and the county governments.\nHow are courts structured, and how do they work? This is one area of the law in Kenya that is least understood. Atieno outlines how courts are constituted, when they sit, what matters can be brought before a magistrate’s court, the high court, the court of appeal all the way to the supreme court.\nThe launch of the books will entail an engaging lineup of discussions, book signings, and networking opportunities for law students, professionals, and legal educators.\nWhat is this book about?\nThis book explores how Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) has evolved in African justice systems, balancing traditional dispute resolution methods with modern legal frameworks.\nWho should read this book?\nLawyers, law students, policymakers, judges, ADR practitioners, and anyone interested in African legal systems and dispute resolution.\nWhy is ADR important in African justice systems?\nADR provides faster, culturally relevant, and cost-effective solutions to disputes, complementing formal court systems.\nDoes the book focus on any specific African countries?\nYes, it highlights key case studies from various East African nations while drawing lessons from other regions.\nWhat are some key topics covered?\nThe book discusses traditional dispute resolution mechanisms, arbitration, mediation, the role of community elders, legal reforms, and the future of ADR in Africa.\nWhat qualifies the author to write this book?\nJulie Atieno Ogolla is an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya and the Founding Partner at Atieno Ogolla & Co. Advocates. She has extensive experience in Alternative Dispute Resolution, holding certifications in ADR and human rights.

    "content": "April Fool’s Day. The rains had fallen upon\r\nNairobi, washing away the dust of months past. A new season was upon the city,\r\na season of departure and renewal. It was the end of the first term and\r\nstudents were going home, their minds freed from the burden of exams.\nEverywhere, the city pulsed with movement.\r\nBuses honked impatiently as uniformed figures, their rucksacks bulging with\r\nbooks and dreams, marched through the streets. Some wore their uniforms\r\nloosely, shirts untucked, sleeves rolled. Others had swapped regulation attire\r\nfor contraband — caps tilted to the side, happy jackets flapping open, their\r\nrebellion stitched into every unbuttoned collar.\nAnd amidst them all, unkempt street kids\r\nmoved like shadows. It was their season of harvest. They chased after their\r\nagemates homing from schools. They peddled sweets and nuts, their entrepreneurial\r\nvoices small against the din of the city centre.\nNear the towering statue of Tom Mboya, a tiny\r\ngirl — her dress frayed at the hem, her feet bare and hardened by the concrete\r\njungle — stepped forward. She blocked some students, weaving between them like\r\na determined fly refusing to be swatted away. They laughed as they dodged her,\r\nsidestepping, teasing. Then one of them pushed her away.\nThe girl’s sweets bowl tilted, then fell. The\r\nsweets scattered, some landing in puddles, some rolling towards the filthy\r\ngutters. For a moment, the street-girl stood frozen, her breath catching\r\nbetween her ribs. The laughter of the students faded as they walked on, their\r\namusement fleeting, their cruelty unmarked. But one student lingered.\nShe was different. An albino with double\r\nponytails tied high, her lips stained red from a half-eaten lollipop. She bent,\r\nretrieving the sweets that had remained untouched by the murky rainwater.\r\nCarefully, she placed them back in the fallen bowl.\nI had watched it all from a few paces away.\r\nSomething in my chest tightened, and I stepped forward. Near my worn-out\r\nakalas, I picked up two fallen sweets and dusted them lightly. Then, reaching\r\ninto my pocket, I retrieved a 20 bob coin and held it between my fingers. I\r\nextended it towards them.\nBoth girls, one in school shoes, the other with\r\nbare feet, reached out their hands simultaneously. Their palms, though\r\ndifferent in texture, stretched with equal yearning. One, out of generosity;\r\nthe other, out of need. I hesitated.\nInstead of giving the coin, I withdrew it\r\nslightly and spoke, my voice measured.\n“Shake hands first.”\nThey looked at me, then at each other. There\r\nwas a pause, a hesitation that seemed to stretch longer than the space between\r\nthem. Then, slowly, the schoolgirl reached out first. The street child\r\nfollowed. Their fingers met in a clasp — brief, hesitant, but true.\nI handed the coin to the schoolgirl. Without\r\na second thought, she placed it in the street child’s palm. And in return, the\r\nlittle girl offered her two sweets.\nI left with empty hands.\nBut a full heart.\n***\nLater that evening, as the call to prayer\r\nechoed from the minarets of Jamia Mosque, I found myself walking through the\r\nstreets once more. It was a holy season. Lent for some, Ramadan for others. A season\r\nof reflection, sacrifice and the art of giving.\nI thought about the act I had witnessed that\r\nmorning. The small exchange of kindness, the delicate balance between those who\r\nhave and those who don’t. What is kindness if not a bridge? The schoolgirl had\r\ngiven because she could. The street child had given because she understood the\r\nlanguage of lack. And in that simple exchange, something had been mended.\nReligions speak of charity in different\r\ntongues. Islam has zakat, an obligation to share wealth with the less\r\nfortunate. Christianity speaks of almsgiving, embodiment of faith in action. In\r\nboth, the essence remains the same. One does not give because they have excess,\r\nbut because giving is an act of worship, an affirmation that we belong to each\r\nother.\nAs I passed a small duka, I watched an old\r\nwoman slip a coin into the trembling hands of a beggar. She did not stop, did\r\nnot ask for gratitude. She simply walked on, her act unseen by most, yet seen\r\nby the One who matters.\nI wondered, then, about the Kenya we are\r\nbuilding. A Kenya where students laughed as they pushed a child into the rain,\r\nbut also a Kenya where one among them bent down to help. A Kenya where the rich\r\nfortified their homes, but also a Kenya where a mother somewhere still left an\r\nextra plate at the table, just in case a visitor arrived unannounced.\nWhat lessons did we leave our children? What\r\nvalues did we reinforce?\nKindness is taught not in words but in acts.\r\nA father who gives his last coin to a hungry stranger teaches his son\r\ngenerosity without ever speaking a lesson. A mother who refuses to let a beggar\r\nwalk away empty-handed plants seeds of empathy in her daughter’s soul.\nWe are the sum of what we pass down. If we\r\nteach our young to hoard, to mock the weak, to take and never to give, then we\r\nare lost. But if we teach them that the hand that opens to give will never be\r\nempty, then perhaps there is hope yet.\nThe night deepened and neon city lights\r\nflickered against the sky. In the River Road alleys, street children huddled\r\ntogether, their coins counted, their sweets now sold. Somewhere in a warm home,\r\na schoolgirl with ponytails and a red lollipop lay in bed, staring at the\r\nceiling, remembering the handshake that had lingered longer than the touch of\r\nmetal on her palm.\nTomorrow, the sun would rise again. Another\r\nlesson. Another chance to build a motherland where the art of giving would be\r\nstronger than the habit of taking.\nAnd I, a poet in a world that often forgets\r\npoetry, would keep writing about it, reminding us of the things we must never\r\nforget.",

    "summary": "Female doctor embodies the spirit of the Kenyan woman: unwavering, nurturing, formidable",
    "content": "Last Saturday, I found myself at a hospital owned by\r\nKenyan Indians who revere Guru Nanak. My body, once a vessel of poetic musings,\r\nhad become an arena of agony.\nThe pain nestled at the base of my spine, a relentless\r\nwhisper of discomfort that had perplexed not only me but also the mothers of my\r\nchildren.\nI had gone to bed with no pain whatsoever, only to wake\r\nup the next day with my body in pain all over. I was reminded of a Kafkaesque\r\ntransformation, where the protagonist of Kafka’s famous tale “The\r\nMetamorphosis” went to bed only to wake up at dawn as a horrible bug!\nWith cautious steps, I made my way to the hospital. Like\r\nany ordinary Kenyan, I filled out the required forms, a task ingrained in our\r\neducation system from childhood. I waited my turn, sitting beside a tapestry of\r\nKenya’s ethnic and religious diversity. We were all bound by a common frailty,\r\nyearning for relief.\nAt triage, a young Gen Z nurse measured my height and\r\nweight with effortless efficiency. One earbud dangled from her ear and four\r\nearrings adorned its lobe. She inquired about my pain with a keen curiosity,\r\nusing the word “corpus” instead of “body”.\nI smiled at her word choice, knowing well its\r\netymological kinship with “corpse” and “corps”. As a teacher of literature,\r\nwords are my daily bread, and even in intense pain, I could appreciate their\r\nnuance.\nI sat among my fellow sufferers, hoping that the Nigerian\r\ndoctor on duty, whom I had encountered before, would attend to me. But fate had\r\ndifferent plans.\n“Next!” called a voice from a nearby consultation room.\r\nMy name was summoned. With the Gen Z nurse's assistance, I rose and made my way\r\ninside.\nThere, seated before me, was a tall Somali-Kenyan doctor.\r\nThis, I would soon realise, was the heart of my story.\nShe welcomed me with a gentle smile, her eyes reflecting\r\nboth intelligence and empathy. Despite observing Ramadhan, she was here,\r\ntending to the ailing with an empty stomach and an unwavering spirit. I shared\r\nmy tale of abrupt pain, my nocturnal metamorphosis.\nShe listened, truly listened.\nHer gaze, framed by thin spectacles, remained fixed on\r\nme, nodding thoughtfully as I spoke.\n“It’s not your kidneys,” she said with certainty. “They\r\nare positioned higher. Banish that worry. You’re not in grave danger.”\nHer words, simple yet profound, peeled away layers of my\r\nanxiety. I had long feared kidney failure, a silent thief that once stole a\r\nbeloved teacher from my life.\nShe sent me for lab tests, X-rays and a CT scan, later\r\nprescribing medication and scheduling a session with a physiotherapist. “Your\r\ncareer is demanding on your posture,” she explained. “The prolonged sitting,\r\nthe endless lectures, the writing — they have consequences. This is wear and\r\ntear, a conversation between time and the body.”\nAs we spoke, a nurse peeked into the room, whispering an\r\nurgent question:\n“A Somali mother is asking if it is Haram to give her\r\nbaby water during Ramadhan.”\nA flicker of exasperation crossed the doctor’s face. With\r\na voice firm yet kind, she replied, “Give the child both water and painkiller\r\nsyrup. The fever is at 39.4 degrees.” Then, turning back to me, she said, “The\r\nAlmighty is not just compassionate; He is all-knowing and understanding. Do you\r\nagree?”\nI nodded, humbled.\nThis woman, this healer, was a reflection of the\r\nbrilliance and resilience of Kenyan women in professional spaces.\nIn her, I saw the embodiment of modern Kenyan womanhood:\r\ndedicated, knowledgeable and compassionate, yet unshackled by dogma. Her faith\r\nwas not a chain but a guiding light, illuminating her path without dimming her\r\nreason.\nWomen like her sustain this nation, their contributions\r\nspanning medicine, academia, law, business and beyond. From Prof Micere Mugo,\r\nwho wielded words like a warrior, toChief Justice Martha Koome, who shattered\r\nceilings with the gavel of justice, Kenyan women continue to redefine excellence.\r\nThey are the quiet architects of progress, their labour often unseen but\r\nindispensable.\nIn hospitals, they soothe the suffering; in classrooms,\r\nthey mould minds; in courtrooms, they champion justice; in fields and markets,\r\nthey sustain economies. Yet, their triumphs are often muted, their struggles\r\nrarely acknowledged in the grand narrative of nationhood.\nAs we celebrate International Women’s Month, let us not\r\nmerely offer perfunctory praise. Let us, instead, amplify their stories,\r\nadvocate for their rights and recognise their indispensable roles.\nThis fasting doctor, unbothered by dogma and driven by\r\nduty, is but one among countless heroines. She embodies the spirit of the\r\nKenyan woman: unwavering, nurturing, formidable. And though she may not seek\r\naccolades, her existence itself is an ode to what is possible when women are\r\nempowered.\nAs I left her office, prescription in hand, I felt\r\nlighter. Not merely because of the medication but because I had glimpsed the\r\nbest of humanity in her. In my pain, I had found poetry. Not in ink but in\r\nkindness, in a healer who, even on an empty stomach, nourished the world around\r\nher.\nTo be unwell is to encounter imbalance. To be cared for\r\nby a woman of such brilliance is to witness balance restored, not just in the body\r\nbut in the very fabric of society.\nAnd that, I believe,\r\nis something worth celebrating.",

    "content": "The\r\nwind moaned through the entangled mangroves lining the banks of the coastal\r\ncreek, a ghostly whisper carrying the scent of brine and decay. The season of\r\nhunger had sharpened men’s tempers, and the drought had parched not only the\r\nearth but also the patience of those who toiled upon it.\nUnder\r\nthe cover of darkness, the villagers gathered like a tide, their torches\r\nlicking at the night with tongues of flame. An old woman, frail and bent by years\r\nof labour, stood bound at the stake, her grey hair gleaming under the fiery\r\norange glow.\nAccusations\r\nhissed through the crowd like the slithering of serpents: she had cursed the\r\nland, called upon spirits to withhold the rains, brought death to the children.\r\nHer protests were lost beneath the roar of righteous fury. The first stone\r\nstruck her temple, the second shattered her ribs. The flames followed, turning\r\nher agony into cinders that rose with the coastal wind.\n***\nFar in\r\nthe southwestern highlands, the night pulsed with the growl of distant thunder.\r\nBetween the rolling slopes of banana plantations, another tragedy unfolded.\r\nHere, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth, and the flickering\r\nlanterns of angry men cut through the gloom like fireflies possessed by malice.\nThe\r\nelders, grizzled men with hollowed cheeks and sunken eyes, had convened, declaring\r\na frail grandmother guilty of sorcery. A boy had died of an illness no healer\r\ncould cure. The land had yielded little but rotting stems. Lightning had split\r\nthe great eucalyptus in the village square.\nSurely,\r\nthis was her doing.\nAs the\r\nfirst lash of the whip tore through her skin, she did not scream. As the blows\r\nfell like relentless rain, she did not plead. But when the sharpened panga\r\nblade met her throat, her silence turned eternal. In the distance, the storm\r\nraged on.\n***\nThe\r\nwind of time bends the bough of life, and upon the fragile shoulders of age,\r\nwisdom rests. Yet in the lands where coastal winds dance upon sunlit shores,\r\nand in Nyanza where highland mists weave among tea bushes, there festers an\r\naffliction most vile: the slaughter of elder women under the ignominious brand\r\nof witchcraft.\nThisspectreof female gerontocide (the murder of aged\r\nwomen) darkens our moral existence, revealing an abyss of greed, ignorance and\r\npatriarchal violence.\nThe\r\nyouthful phase of a woman is a season of toil and nurture; her middle years, a\r\ntime of sacrifice and resilience. But in her twilight, where there should be\r\nreverence, there lurks the shadow of accusation. Once cherished as the\r\nhearth-keeper, the wisdom-bearer, she is now seen as a harbinger of misfortune.\nWhen\r\ndid the matron become the menace? When did the bearer of generations become the\r\nbearer of curses?\nThis\r\nbarbarity is not born of justice, nor of truth. It is a monstrous distortion,\r\nan inheritance of colonial fears and patriarchal hierarchies that have poisoned\r\ncommunal ethics. It is the unbridled avarice of kinsmen, eager to seize land\r\nand property, that fans the flames of these accusations. It is the ignorance of\r\nthe young, who mistake the frailty of age for the power of malevolence. It is\r\nthe indifference of the state, whose silence becomes complicity.\nFrom\r\neast to south, the cries of murdered grey-haired women echo. They rise like the\r\nwail of mourning winds, witness to the mob horror that masquerades as justice.\r\nTheir bodies, torched and dismembered, become offerings at the altar of\r\nsuperstition. Yet no god receives them, only the greed of those who profit from\r\ntheir deaths.\nTheir\r\nhomes, once warm with the laughter of grandchildren, become empty husks, looted\r\nby hands once clasped in clan kinship. Somewhere in Kenya today, to be an elder\r\nwoman is to tread a path fraught with peril.\nThe\r\nsicknesses of age — dementia, trembling limbs, eyes clouded with cataracts — are\r\ntaken as omens of sorcery. A tremor in the voice, a forgetful gaze and the\r\nwhisper spreads: “She is a witch.”\nThe\r\nverdict is swift. The execution brutal.\nThe\r\nmob, like a storm unchained, descends with stones, machetes and fire. And in the\r\nend, nothing remains but the charred ruins of a life unjustly taken.\nThis\r\nscourge is not without its roots. It is anchored in a system that denies women\r\ntheir right to inherit, to own, to belong. A widow’s claim to her husband’s\r\nland is an inconvenience to those who wish to claim it for themselves. And so,\r\nher fate is sealed not by any true misdeed, but by the avarice of those who\r\nstand to gain from her absence.\nIt is\r\nalso a relic of patriarchal power, where women who outlive their husbands\r\nbecome easy prey. A community that values a woman only in relation to a man\r\nwill cast her aside when she stands alone. Without a protector, she becomes a\r\nliability, a threat to be extinguished.\nAnd\r\nbeyond greed and patriarchy lies the deeper sin: the failure of reason.\nIn a\r\nworld where science should illuminate, the darkness of superstition persists.\r\nThe state, bound by duty to protect its citizens, looks away. Justice remains a\r\nfickle phantom, appearing only when the world takes notice and vanishing when\r\nthe embers die down.\nWhat,\r\nthen, must be done?\nCommunity\r\nleaders must stand as one against this violence, speaking against the tide of\r\ntradition that seeks to justify it. Faith leaders, whose words hold sway over\r\nmany, must declare the sacredness of life above the folly of superstition.\nSchools\r\nmust teach the young that age is not a curse but a legacy to be honoured. And\r\nthe government must ensure that elder women have protection, economic security\r\nand the dignity they deserve.\nWhat\r\nis justice, if not the refusal to let suffering be in vain?\nFor\r\nevery life stolen, let there be an uprising of remembrance. For every elder\r\nwoman cast to the flames, let hands build a fortress of sanctuary.\nNo\r\nsociety that turns against its wisdom-keepers can claim to stand on the pillars\r\nof progress. The highlands must echo with the urgency of this reckoning; the\r\ncoasts must rise in collective lament.\nIf we\r\nare to claim civilisation, we must first cleanse our hands of this ancestral\r\nsin.\nNo\r\nmore shall the blood of the wise stain the earth. This is the covenant we must\r\nmake with those who walked before us, and with those yet to come.",

    "content": "Centuries ago, Mwana Kupona sat beneath the shade of an\r\nancient baobab, penning wisdom for her daughter. She spoke of patience, of\r\nobedience, of a quiet strength that would carry her through life. And today,\r\nsociety still holds those words before you, wrapped in modern fabric.\nYou may go to university, but they still whisper that\r\nyour true worth will be measured in your home. You may earn your own money, but\r\nyou are still expected to keep the fire burning in the hearth. You may rise in\r\nthe boardroom, but when the weight becomes too heavy, they still expect you to\r\nstep back and let the men lead.\nAnd so I ask you,is the door truly open, or is it\r\njust painted to look like the sky?\nLook around you. The world is shifting beneath your feet.\r\nThe dhows that once carried spices across the Indian Ocean now sail alongside\r\nsteel giants.\nThe ancient alleys of Lamu hum with the voices of\r\ntourists, their cameras capturing your culture like a collectible.\nThe old Swahili homes, their coral walls thick with\r\nhistory, are being repainted and renamed. Everything changes, yet nothing does.\nYou, daughter of the wind and tide, stand in the eye of\r\nthis storm.\nBut hear me:you are not bound to this cycle.\nYou are writing new verses into the old songs. You are\r\nthe journalist telling the stories that were never told, the artist painting\r\nthe faces that history forgot.\nYou are the lawyer standing in courtrooms where your\r\nmother’s voice was never heard. You are the entrepreneur, the scientist, the\r\nprofessor shaping young minds.\nYou are the daughter who refuses to lower her voice, the\r\nwife who builds beside her husband, not behind him. You are the mother who\r\nteaches her son that respect is not a gift but a foundation.\nYet I know, it is not easy. They ask you to be everything\r\nand more. They expect you to hold tradition in one hand and ambition in the\r\nother, never letting either slip.\nThey tell you that you must be independent, yet they\r\njudge you if you do not marry. They say you must chase your dreams, but they\r\nremind you not to run too far.\nThey praise your strength yet they still believe a man\r\nmust carry your heaviest burdens.\nBut listen.The ocean does not ask permission\r\nbefore it reshapes the shore.The baobab does not apologise for\r\ngrowing tall. The monsoon does not seek approval before it moves.\nYou are the tide rising. You are the wind shaking the old\r\ntrees. You are not here to wait for permission. You are here to build, to lead,\r\nto dream beyond the limits they have drawn for you.\nYour ancestors dreamed of this moment. They prayed for\r\nyour freedom, for your choices, for your voice. But the road ahead is still\r\nlong. You must carve your path with fire, with ink, with steel, with love.\nYou must demand more than what is given. You must refuse\r\nto be boxed, to be softened, to be silenced.\nMwana Kupona wrote for her daughter, but no one wrote for\r\nyou.\nWrite your own story. Let it echo through time. Let it be\r\nsung on the lips of the wind, carried by the waves and carved into the stones\r\nof this land.\nWith the ink of the ancestors and the fire of the new\r\ndawn.\n***\nAs the world marks International Women’s Month, a time dedicated to\r\ncelebrating the achievements, resilience and progress of women across\r\ngenerations, the message of this letter resonates even more profoundly.\nIt is a reminder that while strides have been made in education,\r\nleadership and economic empowerment, cultural expectations still shape the\r\nrealities of many women, especially in Kenya and the broader African context.\nThis month calls for reflection, not only on how far we have come but\r\nalso on the invisible barriers that persist. It is a moment to amplify voices\r\nthat challenge outdated norms, to honour the women who have broken barriers,\r\nand to encourage the next generation to forge ahead with courage.\nThe struggle for true equality is ongoing, and this letter serves as a\r\nrallying cry: That Kenyan women, like their global sisters, must not only\r\ncelebrate progress but also continue to dismantle the subtle, lingering chains\r\nthat hold them back.\nThe ocean does not wait for permission to rise; neither should women.",

    "summary": "Victory without the labour of preparation leads to regret",
    "content": "The people, in their quest for change, failed to see that freedom must be tempered with wisdom and an understanding of what sustains life. This land, though unnamed, speaks of a common truth: that when change is pursued without reflection, it leads not to freedom but to destruction.\nSeeking freedom is a noble desire, but it carries with it both pitfalls and virtues. True wisdom lies in finding balance. A people who wish to seek change must not abandon their roots, the very foundations that have supported their strength.\nThose who disregard their heritage risk losing the core that makes them strong. The youth in this unnamed land sought to cast off the past, without realising that they needed wisdom to guide them. They rushed forward, eager for freedom, but blind to the deeper truths that would have provided direction.\nWhen they rose against tyranny, they did so with passion, but their passion was unaccompanied by the wisdom of those who came before them. They sought revolution without a clear vision of what was to follow.\nRevolution born of impatience creates only a void, a space devoid of purpose and lasting change. It dismantles without building anything in its place. Their fervour, though intense, was ultimately hollow. It shattered the structures of society but left no new foundation to uphold the people. In their haste to destroy, they forgot the need to create.\nVictory was seen as something to be seized quickly, an immediate end to oppression. But the work of creating a just society is never rushed. True progress cannot be achieved by simply wanting it to happen overnight.\nVictory without the labour of preparation leads to regret. The youth believed that power could be won swiftly, but they neglected the wisdom and knowledge needed to sustain it. They were left with only the bitter taste of an empty victory.\nIn their eagerness for freedom, the people became divided. Once united by a common cause, their differing visions for the future splintered them. They failed to understand that unity is essential for a people to overcome the trials of change.\nA divided nation cannot achieve true freedom. No society can prosper when it is torn by conflicting ideals. The youth, in their pursuit of a new future, forgot that they must stand together to create something lasting. Their disunity was their undoing.\nAs they searched for a way forward, many false leaders emerged, claiming to have the answers to their struggles. These false prophets spoke not with reason but with ambition, promising quick solutions to the people’s suffering.\nBut in seeking power for their own gain, these leaders led the people further from the path of wisdom. The youth, eager to change, followed blindly, only to find that the promises made to them were empty. Power, when sought for its own sake, is a corrupting force. It feeds the ego and destroys the soul of a nation.\nThe youth’s pursuit of freedom also had consequences for the land itself. When they sought to destroy the old systems, they failed to recognise that freedom cannot exist in a vacuum. Without a vision for what comes after, they left the land barren. They uprooted the old structures without planting new ones to nurture the future.\nThe soil, once rich with the potential for life, lay dry. The rivers, which once nourished them, were now empty. The land, like the people, was scarred by the recklessness of change. Freedom, when disconnected from the land and its people, becomes a hollow idea.\nThe greatest regret of the youth was the corruption that came with power. Those who had once fought for freedom now became the oppressors. It is easy to speak of justice from the streets, but the temptations of power are great when one ascends to the seat of leadership.\nThe youth, who had once been noble in their aims, became blinded by their own desires. They became rulers without the wisdom to govern. In their rule, they neglected the needs of the people and caused the land to suffer even more. Power, when obtained without wisdom, becomes a heavy burden. It is a responsibility, not a privilege.\nIn the end, the youth of this unnamed land stand amidst the ruins they have created. The land is scarred, the people divided and their dreams of freedom lie in tatters. The regret that echoes through the land is not just the regret of a failed revolution but the regret of a people who lost sight of the virtues that guide true freedom.\nThey failed to build a foundation upon which a just society could stand. The pursuit of freedom, when not guided by wisdom, leads to destruction.\nNo pursuit of freedom is worth the destruction of the land that sustains us. The land, which nourishes both the body and the spirit, must be protected. True freedom is not the absence of order but the presence of justice, unity and wisdom.\nTo achieve it, we must use the frameworks that have been passed down through generations; the systems of law, governance and moral conduct that have stood the test of time. These frameworks provide guidance, helping us to avoid the mistakes of the past.\nTo the youth of this unnamed land, I say: Your desire for change is noble, but it must be guided by wisdom. Do not tear down what is good without knowing how to build something better in its place.\nTrue freedom comes not from a violent overthrow of the old but from creating new systems that will nurture the land and its people. Honour the soil that nourishes you and the people who walk upon it. True freedom is found in the unity of purpose, in the wisdom to build and in the justice that ensures no one is left behind.\nIn the pursuit of freedom, remember this: Wisdom must guide your steps. Without it, your freedom will be empty and the land will wither.\nBut with wisdom, freedom can lead to the flourishing of both the land and its people. That is the true nature of freedom — guided by virtue, rooted in unity and built upon wisdom.",

    "summary": "Lesson learned the hard way is that dirty linen should not be washed in public",
    "content": "Somewhere in Africa, in the heart of a sprawling animal farm, there were five distinct corners, each filled with black animals of all kinds. The animals of this farm had a time-honoured rule, one that had withstood the test of generations. Every two years, one corner would rise to take the helm of the esteemed Animal Farm Commission (AFC), the governing body that ensured the prosperity of the farm.\nThis was a highly-sought-after position, one capable of shaping the future of all corners, from the mightiest to the humblest.\nThe time had come for the Eastern Corner to produce its next candidate, for each corner took turns every two years. In the Eastern Corner, two leaders were chosen to contest, and whoever won would lead the entire farm for the coming term.\nX and Y were the contenders from this corner. X, a popular figure, had grown up in the heart of the Eastern Corner. He had been a local hero for long, a figure who had often stood bravely to save his sub-corner from the brink of disaster. The government of his land, now supporting him in this contest, loved him, for he had once stood in the gap between bloody mass youth protests and the government, stopping a great political crisis from tearing the farm apart.\nThe young animals saw him as their protector and leader, yet they never understood the weight of the decisions he had to make for the greater good in their war with the government. When he stepped into the contest for AFC leadership, it seemed like destiny had favoured him, and they saw in this a chance at retribution.\nOn the other hand, there was Y, a candidate who had quietly gathered the hearts of his sub-corner’s residents. While he lacked the public charisma of X, his actions spoke louder than words. Y wasn’t about flashy speeches or grand gestures.\nInstead, he built his support in ways that reached deep into the soul of the farm, through his kindness, integrity and focus on long-term unity. His support came from every member of his community who had lived alongside him, watching him grow and work diligently for the good of their corner.\nWith the contest now set, both X and Y embarked on their journey across the other corners of the farm. It was a contest not just of ideas but of influence. The two candidates, alongside their supporters, travelled far and wide, making promises, sharing plans and vying for the hearts and votes of the animals from the North, South and West corners.\nBut X’s path was not as smooth as it seemed. His local sub-corner, the one that had once adored him, began to turn its back on him. Some of the youth there, once his allies, saw him as a traitor. These youth had once staged protests, opposing the very government that X had helped save in the past.\nThey called him a betrayer, a man who had sold out the cause they believed in for the sake of the establishment. The bitterness from their protests spread, and before long, they started an online campaign that branded X a puppet of the government, a label that would follow him wherever he went.\nY, on the other hand, remained steadfast in his humble approach. His community, unified by their respect for him, rallied behind his candidacy. They believed in him and worked tirelessly to show the rest of the farm that he had the strength to lead with dignity. As they travelled from corner to corner, they spoke of his values and his ability to bring the farm together regardless of their differences.\nMeanwhile, X, who had once been celebrated by all, now found himself under the weight of online criticism and whispered doubts. Every time he stepped into a new corner, the rumours spread faster than the wind. “X is a traitor,” the youth would say. “He doesn’t understand us. He never cared about the struggle.”\nThe more X tried to defend himself, the deeper the hole he dug. His arguments were lost in the sea of social media attacks, and his message became muddled. The more he tried to explain his past decisions, the more it seemed like he was distancing himself from the very people who had once been his strongest supporters.\nAnd so it came to pass that the final votes were cast, and Y, though less flashy in his approach, emerged victorious. The Eastern Corner had chosen him to lead the entire farm.\nAs the animals of the farm celebrated, it became clear that the bitterness from X’s community had played a pivotal role in the outcome. By undermining their own candidate, the youth had only strengthened Y’s chances. Their division had allowed unity to bloom in another corner, and the farm would now have a leader who had the backing of not just his community but the strength of a unified vision for the future.\nAs the contest ended, the wise old tortoise, who had watched everything unfold, gathered the animals around. “Listen carefully, young ones,” the bald kobe said, his voice deep and full of wisdom. “There are two lessons to be learned from this contest.”\nThe animals gathered closer, eager to hear what the elderly kobe had to say.\n“First,” he continued, “never wash your dirty linen in public. The world does not need to hear your quarrels; they are best resolved within your home, behind closed doors. For when you air your grievances before the world, you invite others to judge, and once the seed of doubt is planted, it can never be unplanted.”\nThe animals nodded, understanding the depth of the tortoise’s words.\n“Second,” the tortoise said, “always support your own. In the spirit of patriotism, never let your differences tear apart what you have worked so hard to build. Unity is strength. And when you undermine your own, you pave the way for others to take your place. Remember forever, a divided house will fall, but a united house will stand tall.”\nThe animals went home that day carrying the tortoise’s words in their hearts. X, though defeated, understood that the division among his own had cost him the victory. His sub-corner’s bitterness had turned what could have been a triumph into a lesson in unity and support.",

    "content": "On Sunday, June 15, the scent of roasting nyama choma will fill the air at Novotel Nairobi Westlands—not just as a culinary treat, but as a tribute to the men who taught us how to ride bikes, tie ties, and brave the world with steady hands.\nIn a city that rarely slows down, Novotel is offering a chance to hit pause. Their Father’s Day brunch is less about fancy menus and more about something quietly powerful: time.\nTime for fathers and their families to laugh over grilled meat, trade stories across the table, and share moments that are too often lost in the rush of everyday life.\nThe event—playfully themed“Honour the Bond That’s as Strong as the Flavour”—is as much about celebration as it is about connection.\nAlongside hearty servings of Kenya’s iconic grilled delicacy, the hotel is setting up spaces where dads can relax, unwind, and be treated for once.\nBarber trims, back rubs at “Wellbeing Stations,” and a lineup of casual games like pool and darts add to the laid-back vibe.\nFor many, Father’s Day can feel like a quiet holiday, overshadowed by busier celebrations. But it’s the perfect excuse to slow down and feel appreciated.\nPackages for the brunch range from Sh5,000 to Sh6,500, depending on your drink of choice. But beyond the cost, the event taps into something priceless: the joy of being seen and the comfort of being surrounded by the people who matter most.\nFor Fabio Gonsalves, the hotel’s general manager, the idea is simple. “It’s about families coming together, creating those small, meaningful moments—and of course, enjoying great food,” he says.\nIn a world that often forgets the quiet strength of fatherhood, Novotel’s celebration is a reminder: sometimes, honouring dad is as easy as pulling up a chair and making space at the table",

    "content": "The struggles of women entrepreneurs in\r\nAfrica are not just down to a lack of resources.\nAs Mambo Pambo World founder Kawira Mirero\r\nputs it, “You just don’t need capital but patient capital.”\nAcross Kenya and Uganda, women are defying\r\nthe odds to build thriving businesses despite financial and societal hurdles.\nIn many African communities, women play a\r\ncrucial role in shaping economies, whether through employment or\r\nentrepreneurship.\nBeyond providing for their families, they\r\ndrive innovation, create jobs and break barriers in traditionally\r\nmale-dominated industries.\nInteriors Limited CEO Evelyn Zalwango says\r\nexpectations are exaggerated at times.\n“As a woman, people tend to think you\r\nshould be strong through anything,” she says. “But we are human, and we should\r\nbe treated as such. We also go through a lot.”\nThese and other realities of being a woman\r\nin business are highlighted in a new documentary that explores their\r\nentrepreneurial journey.\nAfrican\r\nWomen Rising: In Their Wordscaptures the triumphs,\r\nstruggles and the power of perseverance of women entrepreneurs.\nMany of the women featured began their\r\nbusinesses with minimal resources, relying on personal savings and\r\ndetermination.\nHOMEMADE\r\nSOLUTION\nKawira Mirero started her Kenyan fashion\r\nbrand in her guest room. “I had two tailors, and I used to meet my clients in\r\nthe sitting room. Most tailors weren’t used to this kind of set-up,” she\r\nrecalls.\nHer experience underscores a common\r\nchallenge in the fashion industry: high capital demands. “Every item is money\r\nlocked down, and some designs don’t sell much.”\nSimilarly, Kienyeji Food Store CEO Miriam\r\nNabakwe emphasises the need for patience in business.\n“To build something great, you have to be\r\nvery focused and patient. Through patience, you’ll go through storms, and how\r\nyou rise is what matters.”\nDespite starting with limited resources,\r\nthese women have expanded their businesses, hired employees and created\r\nopportunities for others.\nNabakwe now employs 50 people and\r\nattributes her success to working with professionals.\n“If there are skills I feel I don’t have, I\r\nget experts to help me and actualise my plans,” she says.\nBeyond financial constraints, mentorship\r\nand guidance are vital to an entrepreneur’s journey. Arise Collections CEO\r\nAgnes Netunze believes that continuous learning is important.\n“Mentorship is key. If you stop learning,\r\nyou stop growing. And when you stop growing, what happens? You die,” she says.\nShe also stresses the importance of having\r\na good support system in days when everything seems overwhelming and one wants\r\nto disconnect from everything.\nSpeaking to the Star,African Women Risingdirector Felix Masi said the road to success\r\nis paved with despair.\n“Many entrepreneurs start businesses, but\r\nwithout mentors, someone they can look up to, their journey feels rough and\r\nhopeless,” he said.\n“I wanted to redefine the word ‘home’ and\r\nshowcase what Africa has to offer on a global stage.”\nFor entrepreneurs, feedback, especially\r\ncriticism, can be a powerful tool for growth.\n“Negative feedback is the best feedback,”\r\nNetunze says. “It helps you focus on areas your excited heart doesn’t want to\r\nlook at. If my team missed something, I want to know who is brave enough to say\r\nit as it is.”\nEastNat Ltd director Easter Kojwang agrees.\r\n“Feedback helps you grow. What matters is how you receive it and what you do\r\nwith it. When customers give feedback, it means they value your business and\r\nwant you to do better.”\nAfrican women entrepreneurs continue to\r\nreshape industries, proving that success is not solely defined by resources but\r\nby resilience, strategy and adaptability.\nThe documentary has already received\r\ninternational recognition, earning a spot at the Ekurhuleni International Film\r\nFestival in South Africa. As part of Women’s Month celebrations, it is set to\r\npremiere in Nairobi tomorrow at Nairobi International School.\nMasi hopes the film will inspire more women\r\nto take bold steps towards entrepreneurship. “No journey is beautiful until you\r\njump the cliff and cross over to the other side. Carry on and write the best\r\nchapter of your story.”",
